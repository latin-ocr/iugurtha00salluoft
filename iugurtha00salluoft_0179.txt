NOTES 139

5 tradidisset] :tradideris os Or. Rect. (8. t n.). The acc. and inf.
of course depends on fide data.
ingenio infido] abl. of quality ; see on 1. 1.
per condiciones] ‘by the terms.' We should rather say ‘lest one of
the terms should require his surrender.’

CHAPTER LXII.

1 liberisque] cp. 75. 1.
captos occisos] unconnected: ¹4- ιι n.
1110] 51. 4n.
sibi consulant] ‘take measures sor their own sasety.

3 tradere] of courseztradit of Or. Rect.: ‘he hemby, through our-
selves, hands to you.²

4 consutum] 29. 5n. The summoning of all available senators to
such a meeting is not very often mentioned: it is done however, not
only by the aristocrat Metellus, but also by the democratic Marius
(104. 1). Pompey's counier-senate at Thessalonica would stand on a
similar footing.

5 more maiorum] refers to consili decreto: there were none of the
private interviews that occurred when Bestia was in command (29. 5).

pondo] is a curious example os the way in which the real force of a
word becomes forgotten (cp. sestertium). From such expressions as
coronam auream, libram pondo, decreuit (‘a pound in wezssglzt‘) they came
to write quinque pondo sor quinque libras pondo. The practical effect is
that pondo becomes the equivalent of ‘pounds’ R. 12¹0.

aliquantum] ‘a considerable quantity,' a common meaning of the
word: cp. 74. 3, 79. 4.

7 in Mauretaniam] We should say in not into, but the other is the
regular Latin idiom. So they write Roma ab auonculo ‘from his uncle
at Rome': see Bradley’s Arnold 315.

8 igitur] the repeated demands alarmed him.

ad imperandum] ‘for orders! This phrase forms an exception to
the general usage, which requires that the subject of the gerund (here
Metellus) should be, either strictly or logically, the subject of the
sentence. Roby, vol. 2, pref. lxvi.

digna] absolutely, ‘his deserts’: cp. 79. 1 non indtgnum uidetur
memorare.

9 cum.. duceret. . ,reputa-et] turn by participles, ‘thinking . ,reflecting.'
casus] a rare metaphorical use like our own ‘sall,’ ‘downsallff
