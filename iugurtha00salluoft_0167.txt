NOTES 127

2 namque ete.] observe that the acc. and inf. continues.

quisquam] is more emphatic than the more usual quis, after ne:
cp. ne quispiam below.

ceteris] is neuter: other doubtful practices he did not entirely do
away with (suslulisse), but strictly limitet} them.

arte] is of course the adverb.

transuorsis] lit. ‘cross,’ i.e. across country.

ae] 15. rn.

munire] governs caslra: see on 44. 5.

oum signis frequentes] ‘in a body along with their standards,’ each
in his proper maniple or company, close to its mgnum (Intr. p. xxv3).
[In Liu. 3. 24 frequentem ad signa sine ullo commealu the meaning
seems rather ‘ regular. ']

CHAPTER XLVI.

1 ubi...accepit, simul...factus] Note the variation.

2 suppliciis] branehes of laurel or olive, in token that they came to
sue for peace.

3 Metello] the dative as often with cognitus and kindred expressions:
cp. 75. 2 Alelello comperta. It is really a dat. of advantage or possession,
as is shewn by the parallel phrase compertum habere and such a passage
as 70. 2 ex quo z'llz' gloria opesque inuentae.

'ingemo mohin] for change to abl. see on 1. r.

4 alium ab alio] 12. 2 n.

ἡ diuersos] ‘ apart,' lit. ‘separated ’ : cp. Cat. 20. 5 iam aulea diuersi
audistis where it corresponds to the singuli and is opposed to the
uniuersi of the beginning of the chapter.

postquam...cog·nouit] as my punctuation shews, belongs to multa
pollicenda: we must insert a connecting particle before it.

maxume] 14. 3.

procedat...traderent] The main vb. being in the historic present,
either tense is justifiable in itself: the employment of both is unusual and
must be due to love of change. Cp. Cat. 32. 2 mandat, quibus rebus
possent, opes confirment.

quae ex uoluntate forent] i.e. what would please him. Ex as in

38. 4. For the sense, cp. 47. 4, 48. 1 which shews that these messages
were friendly in tone.

5 infesto] i.e. aeting in a hostile way, ‘ with all the terrors of war,'
as lt were.
