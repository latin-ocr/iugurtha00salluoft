CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY OF THE
IUGURTHINE WAR1.

133 ΒΕ. Fan of Numantia: Iugurtha returns to Numidia (8. 2).

118 Death of Micipsa (11. 2).

118-112 Murder of Hiempsal (12); war between Iug. and
Adherbal followed by Roman interference (13-16); on
the renewal of hostilities Adherbal is blockaded in
Cirta and two embassies² from Rome do nothing

(20-25).
112 Fall of Cirta (26).
111 (Consulsz Scipio Nasica and Bestia.)

VVar declared with Iug.³ Bestia invades Numidia, but
is bribed and gives Iug. favourable terms. On his
return (for the elections) Memmius attacks him.
lug. is brought to Rome, but owing to Baebius’ veto,
nothing is gained4 (27—34).

110 (Consuls : Spurius Albinus and Minucius Rufus.)

lug. gets Massiua murdered and is expelled from Rome.

Albinus, beginning operations late in the year⁵‚ has to

¹ So far as possible Sallust's account of this war is followed. The
dates of events before 111 have to be inferred srorn the Periochae or
summaries of the last books of Livy, and this can only be done with
approximate accuracy. The dates of the consuls are certain. The
chief other authorities are (1) Velleius (lived under Tiberius), (τ) the
Greek Plutarch in his lise of Marius, (3) Eutropius (4th century),
(4) Orosius (5th century). 'l‘he information given by the three Latin
writers is very mengre, but is probably based on Livy's account.
Cicero, Gellius and others also refer to incidents of the war.

² That Cirta itself fell in 112 is tolerably certain, as the war doubtless
followed quickly aster that event. And the second embassy probably
preceded the fall by only a short interval (Adherbal was in great straits,
and had been besiegedfive months, before it set out : see ²4· 3).

3 S. certainly implies that this was done in 112. But Val. Max. says
definitely (7. 5. 2) P. διψία Nasica qui consul Iugurthae bellam indexit.

4 As Memmius was still in office (as tribune) this event must be
dated not later than Dec. 9 of this year.

⁵ 36. 1 distinctly implies this : see note.
