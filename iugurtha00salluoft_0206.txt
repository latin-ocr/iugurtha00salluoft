166 SALLUST, IUGURTJJA

CHAPTER XCVII.

1 pecuniam] the treasure referred to in 9²· 6.

nuntios misit] governs 1116 ensning Or. Obl.

2 rationes] is probably a metaphor from accounts, as we should say,
‘balancing the relative advantage of....’ 1³01- trahere (‘weigh’) see
on 84. 4.

antea] 80. 3.

conpositum foret] 8. 1 n.

3 die] sor this form of the gen. cp. 52. 3.

uictis] :si uicti essent.

nullo impedimento] is an abl. of quality, lit. ‘not in the nature os a
hindrance.‘ Its use alongside the predicative dative is characteristic οἱ
S.'s passion for variety.

utrumque casum] whatever their soi-tunes, the darkness would bc
against them.

4 simul...et] ‘at one and the same moment ...... and‚' ‘no sooner..
...than.'

colligere] ‘pile'
more] ‘ordinary formation)

5 [escendere is attested by a fourth century grammarian: all MSS.

read the commonet· asa]

latrocinio] ‘an affair with brigands.’

ordinibus] they did not fight in centul-ies or maniplesz see on 49. 5.

supra] 87. 3. [The MSS. read simply ueteres nouique et ob ea scientes
which is meaningless That ueteres nonique is right I think certain:
S. osten uses appositional clauses of the kind: cp. e.g. 65. 4 equites
Romanos, milites et negotiatores, 94. 5 cuncti, armati inermesque. My
conjecture is based on the assumption that the copyist’s eye passed from
ea qu(a)e to scientes owing to the similar aeque preceding the latter word.
Then nouique ob eaque became nouique et ob ea.]

orbis] a formation osten referred to by the ancient writers : in usage
it corresponded to the modern ‘square.'

CHAP‘rER XCVIII.

1 quam familiarissumis] generally the cohors praetoria (Intr. p. xxvii) .
consisted of the commander's friends and clients: cp. Caes. B.G. 1. 39
quiex urbe amicitiae causa Caesarem seculi non maguum in re militari
usum habebant.
