NOTES 135

CHAPTER LV.

1 gereret] For the zeugmatic (28. 6n.) use cp. 85. 47 meque uosque
iuxla geram.

’ tamen] refers to aduorso loco.

2 supplicia]=supplicationes as in a few other passages of S., in
66. 2 of prayers to men: Intr. p. xvii.

agere] used like agito (18. 9 n.) here and in ἓ 7 below, 85. 35, 89. 7,
100. 1, 101. 6. In 56. 4 we have the full phrase aetatem agere.

3 necubi] The old form of ubi was doubtless quobi‚ which became
cubi (just as quom became cum). Divide this word then into ne ‘ lest’
and cubi ‘anywhere' (cp. the use of quis sor ‘any one' aster ne). So
sicubi.

opportunus fieret] ‘ expose himself.’

4 insidias] those of 54. 9.

5 praeda] =the later piaedalione, ‘act of plundering.’ The gerund
would be used by most writers.

6 inter se] ‘from each other’ (53. 7). The subject is of course
Metellus and Marius.

8 aliis, post aliis] Before the first aliis we must supply primum:
cp. 18. 7n.

CHAPTER LVI.

1 in ea. parte ete.] seems strange; how could a city possibly be an
.arx regni except in the district where it was situated? If S. had
qualified arcem by some word like praecipuam, ‘the chigf stronghold‚‘
the phrase would be intelligible.

2 quae parabantur] From this is easily supplied the ea (retained acc.)
which edoctus requires: cp. 58. 1, 63. 1, and sor the acc. 85. 33, 112. 2.

defendant] 54. 111. Observe that here S. does not pass at once
into the aec. and inf„ as there and 'm ξ 4 below, but inserts pollicetur.

fauere nequibat] Iug. was their only hope: from Rome they could
expect nothing but punishment: see 62. 7.

3 ex itinere] we should say ‘on the journey‚' but the Latin is really
better, as itinere is Metellus' journey to Zama: Marius was detached
from the main column.

4 fortunam...dare] cp. on ξ 2 above.

5 signa inferre] ‘ advance against Iug.'

6 sustentem] ‘ though they were kept together.’
