INTRODUCTJON xxiii

by lot to what legions they themselves were to belong, proceeded
to select their men. In Polybius' time all citizens whom the
censors assessed at 4000 asses or morel must present them-
selves: the poorer classes were normally employed sor the fleet‚
for the legions only in time of crisis. We know from Sallust
that Marius changed this, admitting all alike without distinction
to the army2—a change which rapidly demoralised the citizen
army of the Republic into the mercenary force of the Empire.
The cavalry were chosen first. For this only a certain class
of citizens was eligible—a class fixed, apparently, by considera-
tions of age, birth and wealthss. Each legion received 300, each
of the contingents being divided int-o 10 turmae& But the
Roman cavalry of the legion had been found feeble in the
Hannibalic war, and later on, in Spain, had shewn all the
weaknesses of an aristocratic corps—arrogance and mutiny.
In Caesar's time they were no longer attached in this way to
each legion: the equites Romani of his army appear only as
officers⁵, or in personal attendance on the general. When the
change was made is quite uncertain. In the Iugurtha equites
Romani are twice mentioned in connection with the army: one
of the references is quite indefinite⁶, the other shews that they

⁸ The class which, in the Gracchan period at least and later, formed
the second class of the community (next to the senators); see 42. 1,
65. 4. Its property qualification in the Ciceronian period is known:
whether it was always the same is uncertain.

4 As shewn further on, it is doubtful if these lmmae of legionary
cavalry existed now in the ordinary military sense All cavalry divisions
were called by the name: e.g. the cavalry section of the cohors praetoria
98. 13 in 38. 3, 91. 1, 99. 1 the word clearly means ‘cavalry' as
opposed to ‘ infantry.' In 50. 5 Romanorum turma is quite general,
and means ‘ Metellus’ cavalry' as opposed to Iugurtha's.
