NOTES 131

inter manipulos] i.e. in the intervals which the Roman battle order
lest between each fighting unit.

pauca...mffltes hortatus] for the double acc. cp. 79. 1 and R. 1122.

transuersis principiis] M.‚ to continue his march, would simply
give the order ⁴ Lest turn! Quick march Ξ ’ This would bring his men
sacing the river again: what had been the left wing of the fighting order
os 5 6 above would be in from, what had been the centre would come
next, and the right wing would come last (hence 50. 2). As they
marched along, the extreme right hand file of the column would be
composed of those who, if the enemy attacked (when the word ⁶ Right
turn ' would be given and the column become a battle array: cp. Tac.
A. 2. 16 ordo agminis in aciem insisteret) would form the first fighting
line, or principia (cp. 50. 2). But at present the principia presented to
their soes not their from, but their (right) sides. The phrase lransuorsis
principiis, then, I believe refers to this and means, lit. ‘ with (what was
to be) his front rank sideways (to the soe)': the use of transuersus in ἓ 1
and in 50. 1 seems quite the same. [The Commentators, so far as Ι have
seen, have not fairly grappled with this phrase. There still remains the
difficulty that, so sar as Ι understand the passage, all the lines, the
subsidia as well as the principia, would be marching in this same way,
presenting their flank to the soe. Why then are the principia alone
mentioned ?]

CHAPTER L.

1 Rutilium] Intr. p. xiv. He is famous for having, when on the staff
of the governor of Asia, repressed the extortions of the tax-sarmers: they
revenged themselves by accusing him, on his return, of plundering the
provincials and actually secured his conviction. He selected for his
place of exile the town of Smyrna, the alleged scene of his misdeeds.

transuersis proeliis] ‘ attacks on his flank.'

2 pro] 9. 2n.

post principia] seems to mean between the principia and the first
line of subsidia, ready to command in the right place, if an attaek came.
In the march he would be rather ‘beside’ than ‘ behind ’ the principia.
principes faeti] see on 49 ξ 6 (last note).

3 ubi extremum etc.] so that Iug.⁷s men overlapped what would become

the Roman right.
duum] asin 91. 3, 106. 5.
. qua] Remember the gender of mons, and tr. ‘ at the point where.’
