cuius...od:lo potentiae nobilitatis] an extraordinary string of geni-
rives, of which the first and last are possessives, the second objective
depending on odio.

supra] 27. 2.

contionibus] meetings called by magistrates. Only magistrates
could speak at them, except in so far as they might order a private
individual to make some statement (so in 34. 1). Such meetings did
not definitely decide anything: often they served the purpose os a
modern indignation meeting and were convenient means for working
on public opinion. Cp. Marius' contio in 84. 5.

prorsus] 23. 1 n.

Memmi facundia] Cicero (Brut. 136) says M. was quite an ordinary
orator. but accusator acer alque acerbus.

reditum] of ²9· 7.

CHAPTER XXXI.

dehortantur...superet] Notice the difference of moods. Deber-

ma] simply points forward.

quindecim] He is speaking in 1 11 B.C. and refers to a state of things
that began with the death of T. Gracchus in 133 B.C.: one would expect
ἰο or 2 5 to be the round number. XV. may be a mistake for XX. (which
indeed some of the good MSS„ but none of the best, read) or XXV.

ut] ‘how.' ⁷

ab] not ‘by' (the simple abl. would mean that), but ‘ in consequence
of.’

obnoxiis inimicis] causal abl. abs. ‘ when they are....’ Obnoxius
means ‘submissive' or ‘at your mercy‚’ ob having the force it has in
obviam, so that the literal meaning is ‘in the way of, liable to har-m!
