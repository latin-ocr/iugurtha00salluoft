NOTES 125

CHAPTER XLIII.

1 foeduS...f0edam] seems an intentional play on words, characteristic
of the colloquial tendency in S. After it, one may almost suspect
stipendiis fdciundis non Graeca facundia in 63. 3.

designati] 27. 2. For the bearing of these words on mense Ianuario
of 37. 3 see Intr. p. xv.

partiuerant] For the active form see 17. 7 n. For the thing, cp. 27. 3.

quamquam] without a verb is rare in good Latin: here, as acm* is
no doubt meant to give praise, the insertion of quamquam was essential.

aequabin] ‘unblemished.' Cicero (Balb. 11) says that in a certain
law—suit the jury refused to inspect his account books rather than
appear to doubt his bare word. Few Romans ever recered such a
tribute.

2 alia omnia...ratus] i.e. in other matters he recognised that he
shared his powers with a colleague: the war he regarded as his own
special task.

3 arma] by the side of tela (as in 51. 1, 66. 1) must mean desensive
armour.

et cetera] 1. 3 n.
4 socii nomenque 1..] Intr. p. xxviii ¹.
ultro] 8. 2 n.

CHAPTER X LIV.

1 proconsule] Owing to the number of magistracies not having
increased in proportion to the growth of public business a magistrate
was osten given a second year of office, to be devoted to duties outside

Rome (usually as a general or as a governor). And again, even
without this formality‚ a general (or governor) continued to hold office
until the arrival of his successor. In such cases he was not allowed
to keep his old title: consul or praetor became proconsul or propraetor:
i.e. they were not real magistrates, but equivalent to (pro) magistrates.
ex] 32. 3.
modestia] 7. 4n.
3 et] only balances the clause with the next one: it=‘ both' and may
be omitted in tr., or rendered by ‘in the first place.’

aestiuorum tempus] ‘time available sor a campaign.’ The delay
is of course that of 37. 2.
