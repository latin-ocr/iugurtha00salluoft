of a praetor (or propraetor as he would be called if, as osten happened,
he came out to the province after the expiration of his regular year of
office in the city). For the praetor of this province see 104. 1.

cetera] an adverbial acc. also found in Livy, but not in Caesar or
Cicero. It should not be imitated ε R. 1102.

CHAPTER XX.

1 contra timorem, ‘contrary to what he had feared would be the case’z
contra ac timuerat would be more usual. But cp. 75. 9, and the common
eontra spem, also c. decus regium (33. 1, 72. 2), c. belli faciem (46. 5).

acceperat] 8. 1.

3 loca] S. often omits ad with adcedo: he is not to be followed in this
peculiarity.

4 conuertit] intrans. as in 101. 6, and cp. 85. 9 (uertit). Here again
it would be rash to imitate: use the passive (practically deponent) or
insert se.

5 neque...et] 1. 5.

omnia] i.e. everything else, ‘ anything' : cp. ²4· 2, 26. 2, 58. 1
etc.

temptatum] with bellum, referring to the events of 13. 3, 4.

secus] otherwise, that is, than was wished ι cp. 2 5. 10. Cedo in this
phrase of course means ‘ result‚’ ‘turn out ⁵: so procedo l.c.

diei extremum] S. often uses the neuter adj. as a noun, with a
partitive gen. in dependence3 the same word in 37. 4, 90. 1 ; humi arido
atque harenoso 48. 3 ; plerumque just below and 109. 4, pleraque 78. 43
propinqua 89. 53 proxuma 78. 2 ; summum montis 93. 2. The use is a
savourite with the poets. See Intr. p. xvii and R. 1290 sqq.

etiam tum] ‘ still’: dawn had not really broken.

togatorum] The word togati was used in ref. to the Italian troops
which served along with the Romans, and was consequently applied by
