INTRODUCTJON xi

by a curious composition, purporting to be written by Cicero
against Sallust1‚ in which the latter's character is subjected to
all the scurrilous abuse which the ancients allowed themselves
and which, if well founded, would justify us in regarding our
author as a monstrum nulla uirtute redemptum a uitiis. That
the work is not Cicero's is clear of course from the style, but,
apart from this, it appears as an answer to an invective of
Sallust's against Cicero, which precedes it in the MSS. and is
exactly similar in style. They probably come from the same
hand, a teacher of rhetoric having composed them as a ‘fair
copy’ for his pupils. Wretched as is the style, still, if we can
trust Quintilian's MSS„ that author cites passages contained in
the invective'against Cicero, so that it must have been composed
before 90 A.D. Indeed, if we once admit that it may have been
written by a third-rate rhetorician, we may put the date very
much earlier than this. As the brief account of Sallust's life
given above shews, we get certain facts from the invective
which are borne out by other writers, but the sweeping charges
obviously must not be absolutely accepted. I cannot help
thinking that Seneca would have mentioned Sallust's immo-
rality, had he regarded him as exceptionally bad2.

Two of Sallust's works we possess complete: the‘de Coniu-
ratione Catilinae and the Iugurtha. In the former he gives an
account of the famous conspiracy, which he, rightly or wrongly,
regarded as a serious attempt at revolution. Of his main work,
the Histories, we possess only fragments—most of thern preserved
in a collection of the speeches and letters which were introduced
by Sallust into his works. That they dealt with the period
from Sulla⁷s death to 67 B.C. is generally inferred from various
facts, and the extant fragments agree with this theory3. So
limited a period can hardly be said to involve a departure
