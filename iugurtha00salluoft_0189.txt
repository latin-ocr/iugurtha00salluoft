NOTES 149

officia. intenderant] ‘increased their zeal in doing services,’ ‘per-
formed their services with greater diligenee‚' doing more than was
absolutely required. Intende here means ‘strain up to a pitch.’
9 religione] almost ‘piety‚’ ‘respect sor the gods,⁷ whose gift they
dared not reject. ·

CHAPTER LXXVI.

1 infectum] ‘impossible': the dat. then is not one of agency.
uno dle] governed by amplius, would otherwise have been put in
the acc. (of duration) and os course might be retained in it even as it is :
see on 58. 3.
cet-erum] ‘but the fact was‚‘ a favourite use of the word in Tacitus.
nam...capi] still depends on putabat.

3 ex copia] ‘ at his disposal.' [Two of the best MSS. read dein duobus
locis and as most¹ of the others read deinde iubet locis, which may well
be a corruption of it, perhaps duobus ought to be read. But the
special mention of two points as being selected is a little curious, and
does not seem to suit ex copia very well.]

meas...aggerem] τι. 3n.
4 prorsus] 23. 1 n.
nihil relicum fieri] Reliqui (partitive gen.) is generally written in
this phrase, which means ‘ nothing was left untried.'

5 post] is of course a preposition here, yet it is followed by quam:
cp. 102. 2 post diem quintum quam. This is quite as good Latin as the
other rendering quadraginta post diebus quam: see Bradley's Arnold,
323, whence it will be seen that quadragesimo die quam (without post)
could also be written.

modo] qualifies oppido.
6 ducuntur] 41. 1.
quas...poenaz metuerant, eas ipsi uolentes pependere] the same
thought in Martial (2. 80): Hostem cum fugeret se Fannius ipse peremit:
Hic, rogo, nonfuror est—ne moriare, mori.

CHAPTER LXXVII.

1 Lepti] the town of 19. 3.
Hamilcarem.. studere] for the acc. and inf. see on 8. 2.
nobilem factiosum] asyndeton as in 14. 1 1 n.

festinaret] :festinabis of Or. Rect. : 8. 1 n. So morumzuestri.
