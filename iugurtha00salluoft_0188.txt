148 SALLUST, JUGURTHA

tuta] is attracted to the gender os arma: cp. Ou. Tr. 1. 2. r quid
enim nisi uota supersunt. As regards the meaning os the sentence, S.
says with grim humour that their feet are safer than their weapons
—the latter they throw away and leave to sall into the enemy’s hands.
S. has already ventured on something very near to a pun (43. 1 n.): cp.
too 107. 1 ab inermis pedibus auxilium petere. The alternative ex-
planation, that tuta is used actively, ‘protecting‚’ gives that word a
meaning which it nowhere else bears. [The old reading Numidas...
tutata is easy enough, but only a few good MSS. appear to present
either of the words, and only one presents both, in this form.]

CHAPTER LXXV.

1 modo] 47· 311.
111 oppidum] the prep. is required where oppidum is used in ap·
position: cp. 102. 1 and R. 1111.

there was a large establishment there sor the training of the young
princes„ Pueritiae defines the nature of the cultus: ‘establishment sor
the early training of....’

4 eo] though referring to pecoris, is the adverb: see on 66. 2.
cuiusque modi] ‘of various descriptions,‘ especially of various
materials, as lzjg‘nea shews.
5 portaret] directly dep. on imperat: 28. 1 n.
fuerint] must be perf. subj. of virtual Or. Obl. and represents the
future perfect of Or. Rect. M. says ibi...fiterilis. In old Latin the
fut. perf. is often equivalent to the future: here there is the further idea
of ‘you will have got there by the time we arrive.' [But Kritz‘s sorem is
simpler.]
6 quam] refers to flumen, but is attracted by aquam : 41. 1 n.
7 quo...praeeeperat] 64. 1 n.
