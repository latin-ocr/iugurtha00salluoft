the Mediterraneanl. One might, Ι think, fairly call Sallust's
style ‘breathless,' in view of the hurried way in which he throws
in a parenthesis, long or short2, with the appearance osone who
is hastening on to more important matters—in fact, as was
said of his model Thucydides, breuis et semper instans sibi.

111. Variety.

Attention has been drawn to this so often in the notes3 that
it is not necessary to say much here. Here I note in order:
4. 2 quia multi dixere...simul ne quis existumet, IA. 3 uellem...

commonness of such words and phrases as ad hoc, agitare, artes,
habere& mortales, ea tempestate and slovenly repetitions (eg. of
procedere thrice in 6 lines : 21. 1 and 2).

Both as a historian and as a stylist Sallust was highly
esteemed by the ancients——not only by soolish people like
Arruntius⁵, who slavishly copied his unusual expressions and
introduced them at every turn, or in a conventional way (as, sor
example, by Martialss), but by Quintilian⁷ and, above all, by
