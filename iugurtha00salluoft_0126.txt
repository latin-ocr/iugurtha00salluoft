86 SALLUST, IUGURTHA

CHAPTER IV.

1 memoria] ‘ recording.'

2 simul ne] Observe how S. secures variety: he has two reasons for
omitting: one is introduced by quia, the other by ne: cp. 25. 5, where
the reasons are given by a quod clause and a participle.

per insolentiam] goes with extollere.

memet] Met is a pronominal suffix added to all cases of the sub-
stantive pronouns (tutemet is the form for the 2nd sing: in 85. 35. S.
contents himself with lule) and to the abl. sing. and acc. pl. of the
adjective pronouns. R. 389.

3 atque] and there will be people ready to believe this.

certe quibus] as if nonnulli imponent preceded, ‘at least, those who
think-...will do so.’

salutare plebem et conuiuiis gratiam quaerere] For the former
purpose the candidate was accompanied in his walks abroad by the
nomenclator who pointed out to him those whom it was important he
should greet: cp. Hor. Ep. 1. 6. 49 sqq. As regards the ‘ free meals ’ the
law seems to have been very vague. Apparently if a man confined
them to the members of his own tribe no one would complain—but few
did thus limit themselves. Cicero's client Murena was charged with
having gone too far herein (ad prandimn uulgo uocati), and Cicero
defends the practice as indispensable: nec plebi eripiendi fructus isti
sunt ludorum, gladiatorum, conm‘uiomm...nec candidatis ista benignitas
adimenda est, quae lz‘beralz'latem magis segrm'ficat quam largitionem (Mur.
77). Cp. also Quint. Cic. de pet. cons. 11. 44, Hor. Ep. 1. 19. 37-8,

4 qui] refers to all who call his work inertia.

ego...mag1·stratus adeptus sim] Intr. pp. ix, x.

genera. hominum] Julius Caesar increased the numbers os the
senate, without, apparently, keeping up its character. Some of the
new member-s were peregrini (a skit of the day suggested that everyone
should resuse to guide them to the senate house and so prevent their
sitting there Ξ) and some, as Mommsen says, ‘dubious and plebeian
personages.’ Antonius seems to have gone still further in this direction.

5 Q. Maxumum] the Q. Fabius Maximus of the end Punic war. P. Scipz’o
will be his younger contemporary, who ended that war. For both, see'
5. 4n.

imagines] rwaxen masks representing deceased members of the
house who had held a curule (1.6. higher) magistracy. At sunerals they
were worn by aetors who marched in the processions. They were kept
