eum animo suo] the mind being looked on as an adviser. Cp. the

trahere (93. Ι).

3 natura] i.e. the thought that men are naturally desimus. Cp. 31. 1

transuersos agit] lit. ‘drives thern crosswise,’ i.e. off the road,

its generals the inhabitants were able to desy the besiegers and inflict
serious blows upon them until the younger Scipio was sent out in 134.
He quickly remedied the state of the army and reduced the city in the
following year.

4 ut erat etc.] ‘with his industry and vigour.’ There are at least three
good ways of turning into Latin such a sentence as, ‘you with your
usual kindness (will do this or the like)': (1) pro tua beneuolentia,
(2) qua (or quanta) tu es beneuolentia, (3) ut es beneuolus.

modestissume, ‘implicitly,' ‘absolutely.’ Modestia, the opposite of
