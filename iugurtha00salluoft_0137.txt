time, hard put to it as she was by Hannibal. Tr. freely ‘ we had to hope
sor her promise to help rather than rely on her position at the time!
6 quorum] by a ‘ sense-construction' refers back to familia: cp. 28. 2,
35. 6n.‚ 91. 4, 95. 1, 102. 6.
'1 atque] 11. 8n.
deformatus] ‘ with prestige lowered.'
erat. maiestatis] With debere, the gerund and similar constructions,
the indicative is regularly used in the apodosis of conditional sentences:
Bradley’s Arnold‚ 461. Cp. also 85. 48 (decebat). In some cases the
verb in the indicative is really quite independent of the protasis3 as
here, in any case, to help the suppliant was in character with the
maiestas of Rome. But the use of the imperfect shews that the tense of
the protasis had influence.
8 uerum] ⁴ but in point of fact.'
syphacem et carthaginiensis] 5. 4: besides this it was Masinissa's
policy of encroachment that hastened on the third Punic war.
9 me miserum] exclamatory acc.‚ ‘ unfortunate that 1 am.' R. 1128 ε
cp. urbem uenalem 3 5. 10.
hucine] For the i inserted between huc and -ne cp. sic-i-ne.
potissumum] lit. ‘in preference to all others‚’ ‘ of all men.’ Note
the word, and cp. ἓ ι5 below, 30. 4, 67. 1. So potissumus 94. z.
uorsabitur] ‘ be familiar with)
10 iure] ⁶ naturally enough.'
ab] ‘on' or ‘at.’ R. 1813: so a tergo regularly (94. 5) and cp.
17. 4, 48. 3 (a merzdie) and this same phrase 50. 6, 101. 8. The real
force of the prep. is ‘from the side of.' So, metaphorically, 48. 3 κασίης
ab natura et humano cultu.
iussissetis] The subj. is due to virtual Or. ObL, as if he had said,
‘we deemed no one our enemy) Or it may be frequentative: see on
58. 3.
11 intoleranda audacia] may be abl. of quality or it may be abl. of
cause, parallel to scelere, in which case for atque cp. 11. 8n.
sese ecferens] (older spelling for qff), ‘ transported by.’
in imperio] ⁴ under your suzerainty.’ ln is often used to denote the
circumstances and position: cp. e-g. Liu. 2. 15. 3 non in regno (i.e. under
’ a king) populum Romanum, sed in libertate esse, and 31. 11 below.
Sometimes it acquires almost causal force, as in 41. 6, 74. 1, 75. 8,
85. 26, Liu. l-c. 2]- 4 in tanta uetustate, ‘ seeing how great the antiquity

is,’ and so we might tr. here, ‘seeing that you were our lords.' Cp.
also in inuidia 25. 5.
