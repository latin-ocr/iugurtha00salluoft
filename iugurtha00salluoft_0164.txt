ι 24 SALL Um: ΠΛ] (sle THA

maiores] their father Tiberius in Spain and Sardinia, whilst through
their mother Cornelia they were grandsons os the elder Scipio.

eo] 'on that account)

socios ac nomen Lata] 40· 25 equites Romanos: the member-s os the
‘ordo cqucstm's, second only to the senatorial body: Intr. p. xxiii³. As
the senators were forbidden to engage in trade, etc., the equites, as the
next wealthiest class, undertook the work: they corresponded to our
merchants and capitalists.

The lzislory is, as so often in S.‚ very inaccurate. The Latius did
undoubtedly feel aggrieved at Tiberius' agrarian proposals, which in
some way or other evidently injured thern. Their protests were
supported by the younger Scipio, who was thereupon assassinated by
some member of the Gracchan party. (Of this S. discreetly says
nothing.) But with regard to the equites, the truth is that Gaius gave
them a number of privileges (e.g. the lucrative seats on the juries), and
thus made them devoted adherents of his policy: it is absurd to talk of
the senate's having estrangcd them from the plebs at this time.

societatis] ‘share in their privileges.’

tribunum] of course refers to Tiberius. Gaius had been tribune in
the successive years 123, 122, but at the time of his death he was only a
member of the board os three appointed to superintend‘*the founding
of certain colonies‚ notably that of Iunonia on the site of Carthage.

coloniis deducundis] a dat. of work contemplated: R. 1156.

3 bono] is masculine: ‘a good man would rather put up with defeat
than resist wrong by a means that is likely to be a bad precedent’: even
if the Gracchi went too sar, the nobles, had they been boni, would not
have resisted unconstitutionally. [I cannot help thinking that bono
might be neuter: ‘to be carried away by a good tendency, as the
G. were, is better than to punish a breach of the law in the dangerous
way adopted by the nobles.']

4 extinxit] really suits even fuga: exile was civil death, and caput is
used for ‘ civil rights ’ as well as ‘ life.’

in relicum]=the commoner z'n posterum.

pessum dedit] 1. 4.

dum...u01unt] ‘in their desire’: 4. 9n.

alteri] for the pl. denoting ‘each party’ see on 18. η.

δ studiis] almost ‘strife.’

pro] 9. 211.
res] as in 17. ι.
