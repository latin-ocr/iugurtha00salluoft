NOTES 85

rerum publicarum] ‘politicsss

hac tempestate] Intr. p. ix.

uirtuti] ‘merit.' honos, ‘the honours of office) S. is really playing
on the two meanings of the word (1) ‘ magistracy,' (2) ‘honour’: hence
honesti below.

quibus...fujt] ‘who have got it.’

2 nam etc.] S. has just said magistrates nowadays are not sase or
honoured because of their position. Now he gives the proofs. Is they
use force, that is tyranny, and the natural end will be a tyrant’s fate—
even is their aims are good. If they don't use force, and keep to eon-
stitutional means they will find themselves powerless and only get
unpopular: only a fool would do this (and a fool is not honoured: see on
ἓ 3)-

quidem] is the Greek μὲν, ‘on the one hand‚’ and is answered by
autem below.

parentes] doubtless means ‘one's parents'; one ought not to use
violence to one's country, any more than one should to them. [This is
rnade practically certain by the 7th letter of Plato which S. is using
here: πατέρα...ἣ μητέρα οὐχ ὅσιον προσβιάζεσθαι.]

possis] As quamquam takes the ind„ the subjunctive here cannot
be dependent on it, but is potential. Cp. 31. 28 n. and R. 1546. Tr.
‘though, it is true, one might be able to. '

inportunum] ‘oppressive,' ‘the act of a tyrant.' The adj. is regularly
used of tyrants and their ways: cp. e-g. Cic. Rep. 1. 33, Verr. II. 5. 40.
103, Liu. 29. 17. 20.

mutationes] ‘altempls to alter.'

portendant] ‘are the prelude t0‚ signal for.²

3 frustra etc.] Is S. thinking of such people as Caesar’s colleague

Bibulus and Cato?

dementiae] The thought is, ‘ and one who is guilty of folly cannot
be regarded as lzonestus.² Cp. 107. 1 where he translates the ‘it is
soolish' of his Greek original by nec decem.

4 nisi forte etc.] The protasis suppressed is: ‘one of these two fates
is necessary’: cp. 31. πο. S. means ‘Of course there is a third possibility:
one can serve as a ladder sor others (such as Pompey) to cliinb by.’

inhonesta et. permeiosa] To use force might be fatal, to try to effect
reforms constitutionally brought contempt. This third method is open
to both objections.

paucorum] the oligarchs, the nobilitas: cp. 31. 2 and 8. 1 n.

gratificari] ‘sacrifice’ For the infinitive aster lubido tem’t, on the
analogy of lubet etc„ cp. R. ¹344 (end).
