xvi THE [UGUR THA OF SALLUST

to fortune1. Monnnsen's reply to such arguments is that ‘the
fact that the author keeps the character of these writings in
the background proves not that they are not partisan treatises‚
but that they are good ones².’ Thus every point alleged against
his theory only raises his estimate of Sallust’s powers. We
must be content to note these points, without feeling certain
os the deductions to be drawn from them. Sallust's account of
Metellus is all that a Cicero could have desired: the attention
drawn to his weakness in feeling hurt at Marius' success seems
due rather to the idle curiosity of the psychologist than politica]
spite. Nor is there any attempt to cloak Sulla's services to his
general: he is clearly the hero os the last engagement in the
book.

Sallust's peculiarities as a stylist may be grouped under
the heads ‘Archaism,’ ‘Brevity' and ‘Variety.’

1. Archaism.

Asinius Pollio, severest of ancient critics, said that Sallust
employed one Ateius Philologus to collect antiqua uerba et
figuras sor his use³. Lenaeus taunted him with stealing words
from the elder Cato's writings4, and others echo this charge⁵.
Modern critics believe that many of his peculiarities are due
to his having preferred forms which others regarded as only fit
for colloquial use. As in English, so in Latin: the popular
speech preserved many archaisms‚ and it is not easy to decide,
in the case os any given usage, to which tendency it belongs⁶.
The phenomenon itself is clear enough. We have

²9· Direct use of Cato's work can be proved, in spite of the fragmentary
state of that writer's literary rem'ains. Cp. with ἓ 85 Cato (ed-Jord. p. 50):
periurium sit, cum mihi ob eos mores quas prius habui honos datur, ubi
datus est, tum uti eos mutem atque aliz· modi sim. See also 6. 3n.

⁶ Probus and Gellius must mean much the same thing when they
call him uerborum nonalor or speak os his nouandi studium. Gellius
