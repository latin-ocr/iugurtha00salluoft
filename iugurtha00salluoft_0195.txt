NOTES 155

the war? There was, I suppose, no question that M. would be able to
gel the men: his imperium would enable him to bring force to bear:
cp. 85. 3.]

4 trahebant] as in 93. 1. The idea is no doubt similar to that of uolua:
cp. too 97. 2 dubium belfz· atque pacis rationes trahere.

5 contionem] 30. 3n. ’

CHAPTER LXXXV.

1 modicos] 63. 2 n.
contra ea] is equivalent to an adverb (aliter or consra by itself),
uidetur being ‘I think!

2 est] The indicative here is a good example of S.’s predilection for
it: other writers would almost certainly have drawn the clause into
dependence on the acc. and inf. (which of course depends on uidetur).

3 cum] ‘by virtue of'; but it also implies that they have not given
him a sinecure : cp. ἓ 28 below.

benificio] 31. 16 n. 3 see ἐξ 8, 26 below.
occursantis] ‘ opponents.'
opinione] ‘than is generally imagined.’

4 clientelae] The word cliens, once used to denote the plebeian in
his dependence on the patriciam, now signified any one who attached
himself to a person of distinction or influence, and especially the liberti
of such a person.

5 procedunt] ‘ benefit‚’ an extension of the common meaning ‘have a
favourable result' (eg. 65. 5). So Ou. H. 9. 109 illi procedit rerum
mensura tuarum.

inuadundi] i.e. attacking the constitution. The metaphoris a mili-
tary one, not out of place in M.’s mouth: cp. ἓ 6.

6 capiamini] may mean ‘be deceived ' (a common force of the word),
but perhaps carries on the metaphor of inuadumli: cp. 16. 4 n.

7 ita...fu.i] 63. 2 n., and so once of persons in Cicero. Of course hoc
ita est (cp. ἓ 4²) is the regular Latin sor ‘this is so.'

8 uti...deseram] One would have expected the infin„ as in Cat. 4. ι
nonfuit c. bonum otium conterere.

9 potestatibus] ‘office,' as in 63. 5.

per ambitionem] ‘to win your favour!
uertit] 20. 4 n. The subject is of course bssnesacere. For the sense

cp. Sen. Ep. 120. 11 more co perductus ut non tantum recte facere posset,
sed nisi recte facere non posset.

10 eum] 6. 2 n.
