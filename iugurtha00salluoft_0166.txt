126 SALLUST, JUGUA’TJM

laborare] ‘ endure toil ’z cp. ἓ ῐ neque laboris patiens.
4 decreuerat] For the tense cp. on rr. 2.

odos] ‘sanitary consi‹lerations.’ [But none of our good MSS. have
this archaic form, which is read on the strength of the MSS. os Fronto
(writer of the znd century Α.Ι).) who quotes most of this chapter. How
little our MSS. can be trusted in such matters appears from the fact that
Servius tells us S. almost always wrote labos: yet in only two of the
four places in the extant works where the word occurs is this spelling
supported by any good ΜΞ]

5 muniebantur] The importance of spadework was'sully recognised
by the Romans. Their armies never halted for the night without
forming the regular entrenchment to which they gave the name castra.
As Mommsen has observed, it gave them power to combine the offensive
and the desensive: they fought under the ramparts of their camp as
under the walls of some sortress. The excellence of the arrangement
was greatly admired by their Greek contemporaries (Polybius and Philip
of Macedon, sor instance). The phrase recurs 45. 2, 75. 7, 82. 1, 100. 4.

deducebantur] to their posts.

diu] 38. 311.

pecoris et mancipiorum] gen. of material or definition.

mutare] ‘barter’ (as in 18. 5 etc-l, uino being abl. of price.

frumentum...uendere, panem...mercari] the corn was not ground
or baked. And they did not care about the trouble of baking their own
bread. Cp. coelum cibum in 45. α.

in dies] ‘to meet each day's requireinents,' for which in diem is
more usual, in dies being generally used to mean ‘ every day ³ in sentences
containing a comparative or the like: Bradley's Arnum, 328 (c). Cp.
however 74. r.

amplius] ‘ besides ' z cp. filices ter et amplius etc.

CHAPTER XLV.

1 conperior] The deponent form recurs in 108. 3; it is an archaism‚
used also by Tacitus (in A. 4. 20, where he clearly has this passage
in mind).

ambitionem] Ambitio and its derivatives are often used of officers
who strive to be popular with their troops: cp. 64. 5, 96. 3: 100. 5.
Here it really means ‘indulgence‚’ allowing them license in the hope
of winning their favour.

moderatum] ‘he steered.’
