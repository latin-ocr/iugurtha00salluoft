NOTES 1 1 7

it depends on a subjunctive clause (ne...mallet): indeed it is practically
subordinate to Or. Obl.; cp. 35. 2.
minoris] 24. 7n.

CHAPTER XXXIII.

1 contra decus] 20. 1 n.

2 tametsi etc.] S. appears to mean that, though he had plenty of
impudence, he took the advice of his friends and did not rely on his
own efforts entirely.

marat] 10. 4n.
ius et iniurias] 31· 12 n.
foret] final subj„ as cuz'us-zul eius.
3 contione] 30. 3n.

aperiret] the subj. is due to the Or. Ob1.; for the tense ( :aperiet
of Or. Rect.) cp. on 8. 1.

consulens] ‘desirous of satisfying the claims of’: cp. 35. 9, and for
the sense Cat. 51. 7 ne plus apud uos ualeat P. Lentuli...scelus quam
nostra dzgszz'las, neu magis irae nostrae quam famae consulatis.

per sese] ‘as far as he was concerned,' as often: cp. 64. 3, and
especially 102, 9.

4 Romae Numidiaeque] are, 1 should suppose, genitives, on the
analogy of such expressions as Cannarum pugna: cp. too 14. 25
(familiae). Most edd. explain them as locatives‚ Nmnidz‘ae being
used instead of in qumidia by a kind of attraction to Romae. This
is certainly possible: cp. sor such assimilation 28. 6 n.

patrem fratresque] by adoption: ¹4· 14 n.

quibus] Here begins Ace. and Inf.‚ dependent on uerba fizcit or
ostendit of the previous clauses. The que of quibusque of course joins
quibus ministris to what precedes.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
1 supra] 33. 2.

tacere] By Roman constitutional law the magistrate's prohibition,
addressed to Iugurtha, takes precedence of his colleague’s positive
order·

quae ira. fieri amat] is a curious expression. Literally it must
mean ‘which anger likes (to see) happen.' For the personification
cp. 41. 3 quae secundae res amant. [But S. must surely have had in
mind the Greek use of φιλεῖν ‘to be aeeustomed.’ If so he has inter-
preted it strangely, for ἅ φιλεῖ ’γίγνεσθαι would lead to quaefieri amant
in Latin, and we should then have to add ira as abl-J
