176 SALLUSJg JUG URTJJA

2 negitare] passes into the force of dicere: see on 106. 3.
cognationem] unless Bocchus and lug. were related by blood (a
thing of which we hear nothing elsewhere), this could apply only to the
relations between B. and Iug.'s children.
adfinitatem] through his daughter, married to Iugurtha (80. 6).
interuenisse] ‘formed a connexion between them.'
metuere] is probably historic inf. [In any writer but S. we might
feel sure it was not Or. Obl., because of the erant of the relative clause:
this tells little here (see on 54. 1). However, Bocchus would perhaps
hardly mention here how unpopular Rome was with his people.]

4 pacem] i.e. to make it appear that peace negotiations were really in
hand.

CHAPTER CXII.

1 poni] :deponi of 83. Ι.
2 cuncta] aec. retained stom the active: see on 56. 2.
saepe antea] refers particularly to the aflairs of Albinus, as appears i
from ἓ 3 where Iug. refers with grim humour to the senate's decision os
39. 3: suo alque populi iniussu nullum poluisse foedus fieri.
conuentam] is used curiously here: pax conuenta is the passive of
pacem conuenire, ‘to agree on peace‚’ an expr. which is not found in
Latin. However they said conuentum sor ‘an agreement‚’ which comes
to the same thing.
3 ambobus consultum] ‘act in interests of both.'
una] with ueniretur.
in potestatem] 1 11. 1 (in grall'am5 n. l
non sua ignauia etc.] With remarkable brevity S. leaves us to take
in potestate first with tgnam'a, ‘ who was in their hands through no fault
of his own,' and then with relictum iri, ‘would be left there.' Resides
this, it is unusual to say sua ignauia in hostium poteslate sor qni s. i. i.
lz.p. essct. But sor this see on ιδ. 1.

CHAPTER CXIII.

1 uoluens] :cum uoluisset: see on ¹5- 1.

dolo...cunctatus] the vb. os this clause is promiserit understood: ”

‘whether he made the promise with real or seigned reluctance.'
2 in colloquium] of course belong to the uti clause: cp. on 13. 6.
3 inmutata uoluntate] he resolved not to consult them.
