100 SALLUSD JUGURTHA

CHAPTER XV.

1 inferentem] ought, according to the usage of the best writers, to
mean ‘at the time when he was beginning the war,’ whereas S. means
‘though he had been the one to begin,' i.e. cum intulisset. For equally
free uses of the pres· pte. see 35. 10, 103. 4:106. 1, 113. 1. Do not
imitate, but follow Bradley’s Arnold, 410—412.

ac] of course goes with alium, ‘different srom what they had found
him,' cp. 72. 1 aliter alque, 79. 6 haud secus atque. So after iuxta
45. 2‚pariter 46. 6 etc. where we tr. ‘as.'

2 consulitur] that is, the presiding magistrate calls upon the members

35. 9 etc.

solet] S. regularly omits fierz‘ in these cases: cp. 25. 3, 59. 3; in
96. 3 facere has to be supplied.

polluta licentia] Something is wrong with the text here. One
misses a defining gen. to licentia, if it refers to recklessness in taking

[N ovak’s soluta is not bad]

CHAPTER XVI.

2 homo] uir would be a ,definite expression of his approval on S.’s
art.

p quia consul etc] C. Gracchus, whose democratic measures in 123, “
