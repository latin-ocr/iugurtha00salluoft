150 SALLUST, JUGURTHA

2 inde] is really redundant, being explained by a principio. It need
not be rendered, though its use thus, with iam, is very idiomatie.
3 Metelloque] For que with the last noun only see 011 11. 8.
naue] a rare forrn sor (g)nauiter.
4 emissae] from the prouincia os Africa.

cohortes mgurum] Intr. p. xxix.

· CHAPTER LXXVIII.

1 quos accepimUS...uen.isse] Note that the Latin aec. and inf. de-
pending on a verb in a relative clause must be rendered by the aid
of parenthesis in Engl. ‘Who, as we learn, came....' For accepimus see
Intr. p. xiv4. ⁸

ceterum] leaving aside conjecture, however.

re] ‘facts of the case’ (as described in §3) and so ‘their nature.’
Lucr. 6. 424 presteras (fiery whirlwinds) Grai quos ab re nominitarunt.

2 extrema] Eastern border.

mpares...pari natura] variety as in 1. 1 (see note there).

proxuma. terrae] go together, terrae being dative : ‘parts nearestto
land.’ So oppido propinqua 89. 5.

uti fors tunt] lit. ‘according to what fortune brings with it,’ ‘as
chance brings it about.' This absolute use offero is os course derived
from such phrases as quodfors tulit or obtulit.

alta ana, alia in tempestate uadosa] ‘are deep at one time,
shallow at anotl1e1·.' For the position of in tenspestate, which belongs
to both alia’s, cp. on 14. 1.

3 uentis] abl. of cause, so that saeuire is best rendered by a passive
verb, ‘be made stormy.'
trahunt] ‘sweep about) This rendering is desirable because S. is
here translating the Gk. σύρειν (to sweep) which gaves the Syrtes
(Σύρτεις) their name. So tractu below, ‘this sweeping.'
cum uentis] as the winds shift.

4 modo] qualifies lingua: in all other respects they are not changed.
legum cultusque] dep. on pleraque, Sidonica being the predicate.
regis] of Numidia. “

peculiar to the Latin idiorn: Bradley‘s Arnold, 56.
