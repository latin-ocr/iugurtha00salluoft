160 SALL Um] JUG (sse TJJA

nam] as in 19. ἰ n. : ‘He did not trouble about B„ f01·....’

grauior accideret] ‘come upon him with all the more effect.’

mutare] ‘alternate’

cp. 55 1.c. where cim'tas=ciues‚ and so one may explain Africa here.

use. [This view of mine is, I think, supported by Sil. Ital. 9. 214 licet
auia longe Vrbs agat et nostro procul a certamine distet. Jordan’s cor-
rections seem quite needless in sace os this-J

CHAPTER XC.
