shift the blame from themselves (suamz ‘which really belongs to thern‘)
to their task.' S. is protesting against thc excuse ars longa, uita breuis.
δ quantoJ=quantum est studium quo.

multum] qualifies periculosa.

neque etc.] The apodosis begins here. Ncque...et is common
enough in Latin: cp. 20. 5, 31. 16, 49. 5 etc. In Engl. we must be
content to tr. neque as though it were simply non.

magis quam] ‘so much as’: cp. 36. 3.

pro] ‘instead of.’

CHAPTER ΙΙ.

1 anima] generally-:the vital principle} as e.g. where Juvenal (¹5· ¹47

2 praeclara facies etc.] Ancient philosophers (e.g. Plato) divided
‘things good' into (ι) goods of the mind, (2) goods of the body and
(3) property and the like. Here, as often, (2) and (3) are reekoned
together, as diuitiae shews: cp. ἓ 3, corporis et fortunae bonorum.

ad hoc] a favourite expression of S.'s for ‘moreover.'

huiuscemodi] -ce is a demonstrative particle sometimes added to
those forms of ille and iste which end in s. In old Latin (e.g. Plautus)
we find it, with the e dropped, added to the other forms ε cp. illunc (aea),
illic (dan). Ecce probably shews the same particle (en-ce). Cp. e.g.

CHAPTER III.

1 eis] artibus animi.
imperia] [superium denotes the power of the hzssglzer inagistrates
