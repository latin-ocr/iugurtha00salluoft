NOTES 129

3 modo] only emphasizes inpensius: cp. its use with imperatives in
colloquial Latin (z' modo, ‘just you go ’).
4 mttebat...expectare] In 30. 3 the historic inf. comes first.
promissa] i.e. their sulfilment‚ as in Vergil's sua nunc promissa
reposci (Aen. 12. 2).

CHAPTER XLVIII.

1 anenata] ‘passed into hostile hands‚’ not ‘become a f0e‚‘ as 66. 2
shews.
3 possederat] 16. 5.
a meridie] For the prep. cp. ¹4· 1011.
tractu pari] sc. as the river3 ‘ in the same direction,' ‘parallel to it.'
ab] ‘on the side of‚⁷ ‘so sar as...was concerned ἐ an extension of
the use just noted.
sed] is clearly only connective, 5. 5 n.
quasi] which here means fi're (see 50. 3), belongs to medio.
inmensum] which is practically a noun here, is used to denote
simply great extent: cp. 9²· 5.
pertingens] ‘extending ²—10wards the river, at right angles to the
line of both river and mountain: cp. 49. 1 n.
humi] partitive gen., depending on the (virtual) nouns arido atque
harenoso: cp. 21. 2 n. The abl. is not local (S. would put in), but half
instrumental, half that of accompanying circumstances: the meaning
is the ground allows them to grow.
4 media] ‘which lies between,' bounded on three sides by the river,
the collis, and the mons.
cultoribus] may be abl. on the analogy of that which follows
adjectives of fulness. But for pecore it would doubtless have been
preceded by a.

CHAPTER XLIX.

1 igitur] resumptive‚ not ‘therefore’z 19. 7n.

transuerso itinere] is a puzzling phrase. Apparently it means
simply ‘cross-wise,’ i.e. across the tractus of 48. 3, at right angles to
the boundary lines which the river and the mons set to the planities.
It lay parallel to M.’s route from the mons to the river (and on his right:
see ξ 6).

docuimus] he certainly mentioned it in the previous chapter, but
said nothing of its directiou.
