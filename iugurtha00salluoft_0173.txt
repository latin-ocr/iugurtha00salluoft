NOTES 133

ubique] ‘ at every point.’

explorare] the inf. after remitto is peculim, but based on its common
use aster omitto (e.g. 35. 8).

animo] abl. of place or respect.

uacuom] ⁴ free from·anxiety.'

arte] ‘in close order.'

quo] though there is no comparative: 37. 4 n.

CHAPTER LIII.

ex inprouiso] (le is the prep. usually employed with this word.

aequabilem] it kept its shape : almost ‘ compact.‘

properantes] 22. 1 n.

fugam faciunt] generally :sagana not, as here, fitgz'zmt.

laetique] There were two circumstances that might have led to
their going to meet him (if they went at all) otherwise than instructi
intentique. F irst they had had a tiring day; secondly they had defeated
their enemies and were ‘flushed with victory.’ The conjunction of the
two conditions of weariness and joy is certainly awkward, but S. will
sacrifice much to secure brevity and the reader’s attention. [Lassique
which is generally read, from inferior MSS„ seems too otiose, fond as
S. is of amplisying]

intenti] ‘ on the alert.'

primo] S. meant to end up with deinde...equitcs rem explorauerunt.

inter se] we must say ‘from each other': so 5 5. 6. Observe that
the Romans had no pronoun meaning ‘each other': cp. also 79. 4,
98. 3, R. 2306.

aduentare] the subj. is of course the two parties, under Rutilius and
Metellus. Each gave the other the impression that enemIes were
approaching.

alteri apud alteros] for the plural see 18. 12 n.

paene...n1...explorauissenffl 3 1. 1 n. : ‘ almost...(and would actually
have...).’

mutatur] 38. 1011. [All good MSS. read the much simpler exorlum,
but the famous grammarian Priscian quotes the passage thus, to illustrate
this use of mulctra]

ad caelum fert] ‘praises to the skies,’ a common expression re-
curring at 92. 2 : sometimes laudibus is added.

detrectant] the cause of the action described by the verb is made its
grammatical subject, a strange use. Cp, 46. 6 n.
