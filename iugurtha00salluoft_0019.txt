INTRODUCTION xiii

He is an imitator of Thucydides ¹, and would be the first scientific
historiari os Rome. But his introductions and digressions do
not compare favourably with those of his original. His mora-
lising is like Seneca's, in the Quaestz'ones Mztnrales: one
wonders whether it is as out of character in Sallust as it
certainly was in the other. And in the Iugurtha he often only
repeats what he has already observed in the Catiline. Like
Thucydides, he is fond of psychology. I need but refer to the
almost Vergilian account of Micipsa's perplexity with regard to
Masinissa2, and the alternative explanations offered, in a manner
familiar enough to readers of Tacitus, for the chagrin of Metellus
on his supersession by Marius3. The speeches again are
Thucydidean: they lay no claim to verbal accuracy, even if
they reproduced the general sense of what was said. We may
judge them by those he puts in the mouths of Caesar and
Cato, in the Catiline. There are points in Caesar’s speech which,
judging from Cicero’s fourth speech against Catiline, he probably
did make. On the other hand this same speech of Cicero shows
that Sallust has omitted an important part of Caesaffs proposal.
And Caesar begins his oration in a suspiciously Sallustian way.
As for Cato's speech, it does not agree well with the other accounts
of it, and some of the thoughts contained therein are favourites
with Sallust4. And so it is with Marius' speech in the Iugurtha: it
contains quite a number of translations from the Greek writers⁵,
familiar enough no doubt to Sallust, but strange in the mouth
of this rough soldier who is so proud of never having learned
Greek at all.

It is difficult to indulge a taste sor rhetoric, and yet remain

1 And not only of his style, but in some cases of his phrases and
ideas. From the Iugurtha one may instance 7. 5, 60. 4, 84. 1 (see the
notes).

26.2and3. ³82. 3.

4 The references vare given in my ed. of the Catiline‚ Intr. p. xiii.

⁵ These parallels I have not given in the notes, but they are easily
accessible in Wirz, and shew that Marius had digested Demosthenes,

Lysias and Plato ἔ For the influence of Greek studies on the grammar
of Sallust, see Index, s.v. ‘Grecisms.’
