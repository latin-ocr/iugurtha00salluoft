3 suo atque populi iniussu etc.] a well known principle of Roman
constitutional law, but one which their generals did not always take
the trouble to explain to the foreign nations with whom they concluded

resign the advantages which its generals had thus secured for it: the
mere surrender of the general and his Officers was hardly adequate, and
was sometimes (e-g. in this case) dispensed with. Observe that here,
as at 30. 1, the decision as to the cancelling of the agreement lies with
the senate.
