NOTES 177

uoltu...ua.rius] lit. ‘changing in face and glance as much as in
mind‚' i.e. betraying in the one the uncertainty of the other.
quae...patefecisse] the ace. and inf. depends on scilicet (see on 4. 6).
[But the clause is certainly a feeble repetition of the one before, and
deserves all the suspicion with which edd. regard it.]
5 quaestore] of course means Sulla.
'1 ceteri] the necessarii of ξ 6.

CHAPTER CXIV.

1 Gallos] The Cimbrians, to whom he refers, were of course Germans,
but they had acquired in their wanderings a Celtic element and the
Romans often call them Gauls. The measures taken by Rome to
secure her frontiers in the districts of the Alps and Balkans seem to
have brought upon her these peoples‚ who had for some time been
wandering along the northern verge of the Danube-region. After
defeating a consul in 113, they passed westward and routed a Roman
army in Southern Gaul, after which they remained inactive until 105,
when the battle to which S. refers took place.

Q. Caepione et Gn. Manlio] the defeat was owing to the quarrels
between them: Manlius was consul, Caepio proconsul. The battle is
generally called that of Arausio: 80,000 Roman soldiers are said to have
perished in it.

Italia omnis contremuit] ‘The Romans were accustomed to open
every war with disasters. The invincibleness of their arms was so
firmly established that it seemed superfluous to attend to the pretty
numerous exceptions. But the battle of Arausio ...... produced a sudden
and fearful awakening srom these dreams. Men recalled the Celtic
inroads os the 4th century, the day of Allia and the burning of Rome ......
Through all the west people seemed to be aware that the Empire was
beginning to totter’ (Mommsen, R. H. 3. 184).

2 imque] sc. Romani, ‘the Romans os those days.⁷

alia omma etc.] we should say, ‘whereas all other wars wele easy
matters, with the Gauls it was a struggle etc.’

3 absens] of course this was an honour: the candidate escaped all the
troublesome business of canvassing etc. (see on 4. 3). Later on the
thing was made illegal, and the disputes thereon were one os the direct
causes of the civil war between Caesar and Pompey.

triumphauit] S. says nothing of Iug's end in the old dungeon os

S. 12
