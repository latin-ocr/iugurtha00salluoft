NOTES 145

4 in primo] seems a rare phrase, though Cicero often has a primo
of time (‘sr0m the beginning'). In medio is common enough: cp. in
. postremo 46. 7.
late] ‘in scouting order)

CHAPTER LXIX.

1 animum aduortere] 35. 8 n.
uersum] 58. 4 n.
Numidas equites] is predicate, ‘that they were N. cavalry.'
rursum] not ‘again,’ sor they had not thought so before, but ‘on the
contrary.’
2 uolgum] masc. as in 73. 5.
3 poenae] is rare as a predicative dative, but was necessary from motives
of symmetry (because of praedae).
4 nam] i.e. he had not the right of appeal: see Intr. p. xxviii³.
ciuis e Latio] The regular expression for a Latin in the Roman laws
etc. is the elliptie nominis Latini (eg. ne quis ciuis Romanus neue
nominis Latini) : even ciuis Latinus is very rare. There is no parallel
for the phrase S. uses.

CHAPTER LXX.

1 cuius inpulsu] 62. 1.
suspiciens] Elsewhere the verb suspicio bears the meaning ‘suspect’
only in its past participle, but S., with his love os innovation, ventures
to use it with that meaning here, where the past participle has just
preceded.
ad perniciem] as if he had written dolum idoneum.

2 temptando] is practically equivalent to a pres. participle or a cum
clause. The abl. is that of attendant circumstance or manner: cp. ¹03· 2,
R. 1385.

superauerant] ‘had been too much for'z cp. 64. 1 n.
ini] 46. 3 n.
