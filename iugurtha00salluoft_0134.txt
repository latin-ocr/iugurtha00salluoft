connecting particle (see on ¹4· rr) often makes it possible that he
regards two of the words as forming a single expression (as here moliri
parare: cp. 58. 311.). But in other cases this explanation is difficult,
or impossible: cp. 14. 7, 11, 21, 233 18. 4; 77. 3; 85· 45; 96· 3.
See also on 1. 3 (aliasque) and 51. 1.

neque lenitur] ‘with01¹t...being mollified’ z cp. 2. 311.

CHAPTER XII.

maturius] agrees with tempus. ’

anus auo] In this constr. (cp. 14. 15, 46. 4, 49. 4, 50. 5 etc.) the
pair of words must always be repeated in the mind. Thus, the full
sense here is alius alio concessit, alz'us alio, ‘one went off one way, another
went off another way,' i.e. they went off in different directions.

proxumus lictor] stands here causally=quodp. l. erat. S. is fond of
such appositional clauses: cp. 50. 6, and sor concessive ones 35. 7, 84. 1.
The Roman magistrate was preceded in public by his lictors, marching
in single file. The last of these seems to have occupied a superior
position to the others: orders would be given to him first and he would
naturally be on more intimate ternis with the magistrate. Probably the
post was often held by one of the latter's poorer clientes. Whether such a
custom, or indeed the use of lictors at all, existed in Numidia is another
matter. Cp. 49. 2 where S. speaks of the turmae and manipuli (dis-
tinctly Roman divisions) of Iug.⁷s army, and the use of legio=‘a1·my⁷
in 79. 4n.

sua uisens] ‘to look after his belongings.' Vz'snrus was not
necessary, as uisere means ‘go to see.'

referebantur] inipf. of frequency—-every evening.

ceterum etc.] From promissis onerat we evolve a verb of saying,
to govern this acc. and inf. : see 8. 1 n.

diuorsi] ‘dividing,⁷ as in 50. 5, ¹55. 7, 87. 4: cp. also 46. 4 alium
ab alio diuersos.

miscere] 5. 2.

cum...reperitur] In sentences of this kind, where cum intro-
duces what is really the main clause, it regularly takes the indicative:
R. 1733, Bradley's Arnold 435. Cp. 49, 4, 51. 2, 60. 6,- 101. 8,
106. 5 and 98. en,

Observe the brevity of the description: the actual slaying is passed
over.
