NOTES 91

applied to the general of an army. Though it had lost this meaning in
ordinary parlance (4. 8n.)‚ the military vocabulary preserved traces
thereos in this word praetorium and in the cohors praetoria or general’s
bodyguard (Intr. p. xxvii).

publice...priuatim] ‘by services to the state rather than to indi-
viduals) So below. pauci and multi.

quibus] from quis ‘ any one.'

periculose...emi] see§ 1 above sor the construction of this acc. and
inf.

permanere...in sum artibus] ‘abide by, keep to his present ways':
cp. in bonis artibus retinebat 41. 2.

ultro] ‘unsoughtss The word means that something more than
could be expected happens: so here, not only will he get it, but it
will come to him. Cp. 15· 1: ‘so far. from Adherbal‘s being injured
he is the aggressor,’ where ‘actually' will d0, as osten. See 43. 4 and
esp. 110. 2, 111. 1.

1 redderet] observe the final subj.
2 idem] is masc. and simply means Iugurtha: cp. 3¹- 12. With sit

pro] ’as befits’: cp. 11. 1, 14. 16 etc. and the use of it in 7. 4n.

en] as if he were handing Iug. back to him. Cp. Verg. Ecl. 6. 69
hos tibi dant calamos, en, accipe, Alusae.
suo] sor eius, because Iugurtha is soremost in Scipio's mind: as if he
had said mihicrede, uir art dzgnus, etc.: ep. 54. 7, 73. 4.
3 gratia] that is, with the Romans.
uincere] The inf. after aggredi is found even in Cicero: cp. τι. 3,
75. 2.
statim] as Numantia fell in 133 and Iugurtha presumably
returned at once, certainly implies ‘soon after ῐ33.’ Yet in 11. 6
Hiempsal, speaking just after Micipsa’s death, which took place in
118, says the adoptatio had taken place ‘within the last 3 years,'
i.e. some time in the period 121-118- S. is notoriously careless
about these matters (Intr. pp. xiv, xv) and doubtless did not think the
matter out. Observe too that we pass from Iugurtha's return to
Micipsa’s death by means of the three expressions: (1) statim ἓ 3,

(2) paucos post annos § 4 and (3) paucis past diebus 11. 2, and yet
the period is one of 15 years!
