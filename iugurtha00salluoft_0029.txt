INTRODUCTJON xxv

found no match for the crack Campanian horse. They were
armed with a round shield, leather helmet, some light javelins
and the short Spanish sword1‚ and were trained to ride in
charge or retreat behind the cavalrymen: when it came to a
standing sight, they leaped down and fought between the ranks
of horsemen. The Velites are mentioned for the last time in
connection with this war2. Each of the other classes was
divided into ten units, called manipuffl, each containing two
centuries4. The commanders of these last, the centurions, were
the pick of the Roman army. They were appointed by the
tribunes as being ‘not so much bold and fond of danger as
men with a faculty for command, absolutely steady, with courage
of the deep-lying rather than showy kind, men who will not
be in a hurry to begin the battle but in the face of superior
numbers will die in desence of their post⁵.’ In many respects
these centurions6 correspond to our own non-commissioned
Officers: they came from the ranks‚ and often had to make
up for the incapacity of young officers by their own knowledge
of the work. On the other hand they sometimes tyrannised
over the men, making excessive use of their right to inflict
corporal punishment on them⁷. In every legion was a chief
centurion, the prinn'pilusS, who was regularly admitted to the

¹ 105. 2 uelitaribus armis.

² 46. 7. The practice itself was still resorted to in case of need:
cp. the tactics of Iug. in 59. 3.

³ lit. ‘handful' (manus ple-0), and regularly used e.g. of a wisp os
straw. A maniple of Triarii would contain 60, the others 120 men.
Each had a signum: these ordines, often mentioned, sometimes along
with the signa (45. 2, 51. 1, 80. 2, 97. 5), sometimes alone (49. 6,
50. 4, 101. 2), probably denote maniples‚ though ordo generally means
a century.

⁴ 91. 1 per centurias. ⁶ So Polybius tells us.

⁶ Centurions are mentioned in 38. 3, 66. 3, 93. 8.

⁷ For this purpose they carried a staff of vine wood (uitis). Tacitus
tells us of one who was called ‘old Give-us-another’ (cedo alteram)
by the men, srom his habit of breaking staves over their backs.

⁸ 38. 6 centurio primi pili. Such a case of treachery as is there
telatedis rare indeed among these men.
