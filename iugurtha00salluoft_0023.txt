JNTROD UCTION xvii

(a) Peculiarities os Constructz‘onl.

cases: genitive after egere and potiri, simple ablative of place
with names of countries. Moods: the indicative (1) with quippe
qui, (2) cum or qui causal, (3) in subordinate clauses of Or. Obl.
Here too belong the use of solet without an infinitive‚ ire with
the supine, scilicet with acc. and inf„ uorsus with a preposition,
and the frequent asyndeta. If the reading in 100. 4 were more
certain, we might reckon ficturum as perhaps the most notable
archaism in Sallust.

(b) Peculiarz‘tl'es of Vocabulavy.

Here we have (Ι) common words in unusual senses (attinere,
dolere, supplicia, uerbum), (2) uncommon words like incultus
(noun), naue, prosapia and (3) words and phrases avoided by
Cicero and Caesar, or used by them in a different sense
(cupido, facundia, munificentia, necessitudo,· extorrzssss· ductare,
grassari, patrare ,· super: de; nulla sunt).

Sometimes the vocabulary and constructions give a poetical
colour to his style. As examples one may mention his use of
such words as mortales, uecordz'a,· proficgus; uoluere ( = ponder) ;
of adjectives (especially along with a partitive genitive) as
nouns3 of adverbs or prepositional phrases as equivalents for
adjectives. Here too seem to belong cetera as accusative os
respect, que...que >in coordination, and the free use of the
infinitive.

Of archaic s0rm5‚ such as meet us in Lucretius, we find few.
He has a few nominatives like odos, luxu for the dative, senati
(but see on 25. 11), neglegam, -ere almost always in the third

indeed definitely says in one passage noua uideri dico etiam ea quae
sunt immutata et desita, etsi sunt uetusta. S. certainly has words whose
previous existence we cannot prove (eg. incruentus 9²· 4): some indeed
-dz'scordiosus (66. 2) for instance—are never used by any other good
writer.

and ‘moods.'
