NOTES 93

CHAPTER XI.

1 pro] ‘as befitted‚’ 9. 2 n.
2 paucis post diebus] 9. 3 n.
mi] is dative.
iusta] regularly used of the funeral rites and dues.
fecerant] Do not imitate this use of plpf. after postquam, which,
in S. as in other writers, generally takes the perfect ε cp. however 44. 4,
79. 4 etc.
reguli] The diminutive, as each had only a share in the regnum.

3 despiciens] with iam antea clearly refers to the past ι qui despiciebat
or despexerat would be ‘safer' Latin. However the contempt still
existed, so one may cp. the use of a present with iamdudum. Inserenlem
in 15. 1 is bolder still: see there.

adsedit] ‘took his seat‚’ from adst-dhe: cp. 16. 5 n.

apud. Numidas] and among the Romans too, though one would

¹02. 4 cuius facundiae, non aetati concessum.

transductus] ‘ induced to move.’

5 iacit] ‘ lets fall the remark,' taking the acc. and inf.

quinquenni] sc. proximi, ‘ of the last 5 years-⁹

6 nam etc.] is still acc. and inf.‚ so tr. ‘for, he said.’ For the state-
ment see 9. 3n.

7 uerbum] ‘expression': a meaning almost confined to the comic
writers: uox is the regular word.

ratus erat] i.e. at the time, as opposed to later on, when the truth ⁷
was seen. As however the Latin for ‘ I should not have thought' is
non putaram (i.e. ‘ Ι never had thought ’) it is possible the meaning here
is ‘ than any one would have expected.’

deseendit] Cp. 102. 11 hoc in pectus tuum demitte.

8 moliri, parare, atque...habere] S. does not keep very strictly to
the rule observed by the majority of Latin writers according to which
in enumerations a connecting particle must notrbe put with the last
member only. S.’s way of joining two words together without any
