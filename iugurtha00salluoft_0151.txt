NOTES 111

obuenit] like euenerat (35. 4), may refer to lot or arrangement (see
above, lege Sempronia).

CHAP'rER XXVIII.

1 contra spem] is practically an adj. with nuntio. S. does not avoid
such a usage as carefully as do most good Latin writers. Cp. 33. 4,
86. 3, 109. 4 and note on ιη. 3. Humi in 18. 1 is similarly used3 see
note there.

‘uenum ire] cp. pessum dari 1. 1 n. The phrase is subject to
haeserat, ‘the belief that everything could be bought had struck deep
root in.y Cp. 6. 3n.

miserat] ¹3· 6.

aggrediantur] d pends directly on praecipit. cp. (after persuadet)
35. 25 (after imperat) 35. 4, 75. 5, (aster hortatur) 54.1 etc.; R. 1606.

2 moembus] the simple abl. with recipere seems partly local, partly
instrumental. Cp. R. 1174.

eique]=senatus: 14· 6n.

3 ex] ‘in accordance with,’ as often: cp. 62. 5 ex consili decreto and
40. 5 n. '

nuntiari] ‘answer to be made’: see on 13. 8.

4 legat sibi] ‘chooses as his legali, or staff officers.’

deliquisset] 8. in.

5 nam] seems to explain the hint given by the words quae deliquisset.
But the sense is obscured by the way in which S. has put his main idea
in the relative clause, ‘he had good qualities, aud yet his avarice ruined
thern‚’ sor ‘though he had...yet his avarice....' For this use os nam not
going with the clause which immediately follows it, cp. ²4- 6 n. ⁵

6 sed] clearly not ‘':but see 5. 5n.

Siciliam] the prep. seems omitted for symmetry, owing to chmm.
See however on 79. 2.

transuectae] only applies to the getting them over to Sicily.
with Regium, ductae would naturally be used. This use of a verb
governing two nouns, though its sense only suits one of them, is a form
of what the grammarians call Zeugma: another ex. in 55. 1.

CHAPTER XXIX.

1 temptare] sc. Calpurnium: cp. 23. 1.
aeger] suffering from, weakened by: cp. 32. 4 uis auaritiae in
animos corum ueluti labes inuaserat.
