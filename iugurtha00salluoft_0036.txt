Aulus’ winter campaignl and capitulation. On the
rejection of the latter by the senate, Spurius (after
holding the elections) returns to the province (37.3
—39>-

Metellus receives charge of the war (43. Ι).

109 (Consulsz Metellus and Silanus.)

The mealia rlsamilia becomes lex2 (40).

Metellus in Africa (44—-45). First campaign (46—60)‚
in which he occupics Vaga (47), engages Iug. at the
Muthul (48. 3—53>, suffers a surprise at the hands of
1ug.⁷s cavalry (54. 9, 10) and takes Sicca (56), but has
to abandon the siege of Za1na3 (57—61. 1).

Winter-quarters in the prouincia: Iug. begins, and then
abandons, surrender (61. 4—62). Marius applies for
leave of absence to stand for the consulship4 but is
refused: his change of conduct (63—65).

108 Vaga revolts, but is promptly recovered. Failure os
Bomilcar-'s plot against the life of Iug. (66—72).
Marius leaves for Rome and is elected consul-'⁷’ (73).

¹ S. definitely says this was in Jan. of next year. But see on 37. 3.

² 'l‘he rogatio may have ¹›een proposed in 110 : the exact date when,
aster long opposition‚ it became lcx is unknown.

³ uidet...z'am aeslasem exactam esse 61. 1.

⁴² It is practically impossible to know when we pass from 109 to
108 (see p. xxxiii5), and some os these events here chronicled under one
year may belong to ‘the other. S. however implies in 62. 9, 10
that Iug.'s resumption of hostilities and the senate's resolution as to the
province were almost simultaneous, and the latter seems to have been
decided at the beginning of the year. And the revolt of Vaga certainly
followed Iug.'s renewal of war.

⁵ S. certainly means that he lest before the campaign bEgan: his
words in 73. 1 imply it, and he makes him take no part in the campaign.
Plutarch however gives quite a different account.
