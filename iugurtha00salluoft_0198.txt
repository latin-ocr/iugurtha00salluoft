2 ex classibus] By the old Servian constitution those liable to military
service were divided into 5 classes (‘callings’) according to their wealth.
At the time to which S. refers the lowest class consisted os those whose
property was valued at 4000 asses (up to ²5000)· Those who had less
did not serve, but had to pay taxes like the rest, unless indeed they had
less than 1500, when they became exempt from this burden also. This
last class were called capile censi (Le. entered on the censor’s lists only
for their persons, not for their property tax). S. means then that Μ.
did not confine himself to the people who had 4000 asses or more (who
were in the classes), and indeed got most of his men troni those who had
1500 or less. ⁸
