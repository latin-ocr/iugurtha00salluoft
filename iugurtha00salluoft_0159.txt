NOTES 119

ne sui diffiderent] as they would if he was always retreating.
bem...pacis mora] obj. gen. like deditionis mora 29. 4. He would
not hastily make peace or fight.
ludificare] for the active form cp. 17. 7 n.
3 tum] goes with haud zgrnarmn.

amicissumos fecisti.
magis quam] ‘so much as': cp. 1. 5.

CHAPTER XXXVII.

2 The description shews all the vagueness we expect from S.--especially
in constitutional matters. Mommsen [St. R. 1. 523] believes that a
tribune could not legally stand for a second consecutive tribunate unless
sewer candidates had presented themselves than there were tribunes to
be elected. Whether Lucullus and Annius claimed this privilege and
the others objected, or whether the two men simply tried to override the
general regulation, must remain undecided. totius anni again can only
mean up to Dec. 9, for that day was the last of their office.

inpediebat] Tribunes could postpone the holding of all elections
—except‚ probably, those of their own body.

3 terrore] is of course abl. of cause, explaining why the king should
bribe him.

exercitus] is subjective, ‘inspired by his army.'

mense Ianuario] There are several reasons for believing that the
defeat took place before Jan., 109: one of these is given in Intr. p. xv.
Probably S. simply selected this month, without reflection, to denote
the severest period of winter.

hieme aspera] concessively, ‘though it was severe.’

Suthul] is not otherwise known, but was probably near Calama,
where Orosius (historian of the fifth century) places the scene of this
defeat.

4 extremo] the edge of the plateau: cp. 21. 2 n. for the grammar.

quo] should only be used for ut where the dependent clause contains
a comparative. Here adderet implies one, but S. sometimes uses the
word where no comparative idea is involved : eg. 5²· 6.

potiundi] depends on cquidine.

uineas...aggerem] 21. 311.
