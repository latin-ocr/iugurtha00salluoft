what is coming': for ex, cp. 39. 2, 40. 5. For the thought, cp. Thucy-
‹lides (α. 40) ‘Other people get their courage from ignorance: reflection
brings hesitation.’

6 erat] R. 1711. S. always has the ind. aster quippe qni, but he
should not be imitated herein.

'1 quis]=quil1us: cp. 13. 6, 14. 10, etc.

CHAPTER VIII.

1 nom] 4. 7.

factiosi] influential by means of the factio or oligarchical dique, as
in 15. 4. What factio means to S.‚ he shews in 31. 15 where he says
that to be united by sharing the same desires, hatreds and sears is inter
bonos amicitia, inter malos factio. Cp. 29. 2, 31. 4 (where factionis
potentiae: potentiae paucorum of 3. 4) and 4¹· 6 (where it is opposed to
uis soluta atque dispersa).

socios] the provincials, whom the Romans honoured with this empty
title in preference to that of ‘subjeets’: cp. 88. 3.

mediocrem] 6. 3.

si...oceidisset] a very important use of the tense. Their words were
sz occiderit etc.‚ ‘if he dies-³ In passing into Or. Obl. this subordinate
clause necessarily becomes subjunctive: the tense depends on that of the
governing verb, a primary requiring perf. subj.‚ a secondary (as here
pollicitando accendebant), the plpf. The same rule applies to clauses
‘attracted' into the subjunctive. So 10. 1, 25. 7, 28. 4, 64. 3, 65. 3
(two) etc., and cp. 6. 3 above. Similarly the future becomes pres.
or impf. subj.: 33. 3, 38. 9, 77. 1, 103. 3.

imperi] A gen. usually follows potior in S.‚ though, except in the
phrase rerum potiri, the construction is rare elsewhere. Cp. 13. 5
and especially 74. 3.

m ipso etc.] From pollicitando is evolved a simple verb of saying.
This is a very common idiom in S. and Livy: cp. e.g. 12. 3 (where the
acc. and inf. depends on promissis onerat inpellitque), 14. 20 (after
ambire, fungare), 54. 1 (aster hortor, and osten after this verb or oro:
56. 4, 77. 13 cp. asterpeto 102. 2), 79. 8 (after optionem faciunt), 109. 3
(aster iubet). Less remarkable is the equally common use of such verbs
as moneo, suadeo, first, as verbs of advising, with ut and the subj.‚ then, ⁴
as verbs of saying‚ with acc. and inf. : see for moneo ἓ 2 below⁸(cp. 49. 2),
suadeo 26. 1, instituo 14. 18, statuo 88. 4.
