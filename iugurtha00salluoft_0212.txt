troops in the coast towns: see 100. 1. [But the MSS. are divided between
Tucca and Ult'ca. The latter seems impossible in view of the mention
of that city a little later, where it is really needed to explain praetorem.
Even Tucca is not satisfactory: seeing that S. did not say where
Sulla was at ἓ 4 of the last chapter, he is hardly likely to have troubled
to do so here—where the information is quite unessential. However, it
seems so unlikely that a copyist should have inserted the name os this
comparatively unknown town that 1 leave the words in the text.]

praetorem] the governor of the prouincia (see on 19. 7): his seat
would be at the capital, Utica.

2 in quis etc.] In this sentence there are really two suhjects to
postulabanlnr: (1) the clause legatis poteslas..fieret and (2) the noun
indutiae. So in 65. 2 pelmti takes first a clause and then a noun as
objects. It is all part os the straining aster variety. Ft'eret is really
jussive.

aduersa] the opposite degree or state of things, from good to bad
and vice-versa.

3 quaestor] He would be one of the two quaestores urbani, so called
because they remained in the city to superintend the Treasury.
Apparently Ruso had to bring the money out and (doubtless) return
at once. The actual payment to the soldiers would be the duty of
Marius’ quaestor, Sulla.

4 deprecati sunt] ‘pleaded in excuse,’ a usage apparently not found

elsewhere: cp. however sz' deprensi simus excusemus ebrios Nos fecisse
Plaut. Aul. 742—3.

amicitiam et foedus] 14. 2 n.

5 gratiam facit] ιξναιῖὴιηι here has the meaning of ‘a savour‚' almost
‘a gist.' Cp. the use of condono.

CHAPTER CV.

1 cujus arbitratu] ‘in order that ...... with sull powers on Sulla's side.’
Arbitratu meo, tuo, suo is a common phrase, denoting that a person acts
‘in accordanee with his rights‚’ ‘up to his discretion.' Cuius of course
=ut...eius. as the subjunctive consuleretur shews. .

negotiis consuleretur] ‘take measures to secure,’ not ‘discuss‚' ῃ
which would require de neg. For conmunibns neg. cp. 1228. 2 res
conmums.

2 uelitaribus] 'such as the uelites carried, Intr. p. xxv.
neque his secus eto] ‘and quite as well protected by this class of
