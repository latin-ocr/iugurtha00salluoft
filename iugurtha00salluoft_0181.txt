ab] ‘starting from.’ He held the tribunate of the plebs and the
praetorship, governing Further Spain as propraetor.

potestatibus] as in 85. 9.

ambitione praeceps datus est] After becoming the tool of the
unprincipled Saturninus and Glaucia in 100 B.C.‚ his ambition plunged
the state into civil war. For when, in 88 B.C.‚ he got the command
against Mithridates transferred to himself from Sulla, the latter marched
with an army upon Rome and Marius fled into Africa. On his return
thence, aster Sulla’s departure sor the east, he joined Cinna in the siege
of Rome and upon its reduction took a bloody vengeance upon his
opponents‚ but died soon afterwards in 86 3.(3.

adpetere] seems used quite wantonly for the regular petere (64. r).
Wirz says it means ‘take steps to secure‚' not ‘come forward as
candidate‚’ but this is very doubtful.

superabant] ‘were present in abundance,’ as in 70. 2 it means
‘present in excess'—-both common uses of the word.

mirari] ‘express surprise’: 15. 2 n.

praua] either generally ‘out of place‚’ or specially of ambition:
Tac. A. 3. 56 praua spes.

res] ‘fortunes,' as in 33. 2.
