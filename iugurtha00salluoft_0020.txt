xiv THE [UGURTHA OF SALLUST

accurate. What care has Sallust taken to ensure that his account
is correct and clear? In the Catiline he does not once refer to
any literary authority for his statements. In the Iugurtha he
does mention Sisenna¹‚ as having dealt with Sulla’s relations to
Marius, and in his description of Africa he cites the libri Punici
of king Hiempsal2. These latter however he might as well have
lest unread, if we may judge from the ridiculous attempt at
ethnography which he has extracted from them. It is also very
probable that he used the autobiography of Rutilius Rufusss—
especially as his account of the battle at the Muthul, in which
that officer took a prominent part, is exceptionally vivid and
circumstantial4. But how little he troubled about details is well
seen from the fact that, though as governor os Numidia he had
exceptional facilities for studying the country, no one would infer
from this book that he had ever seen it. Not a word has he to
say of the striking position of Cirta⁵ : with all his affected desire
for historical fact, he does not note how little the position of the
arae Philaenorum accords with the tale which attaches to
themss. For comparison of records or topographical investigation
Sallust has evidently no bent.

Now Livy, though not averse from parading the names of
his ‘authorities‚' shared this dislike for the trouble of research.
But, at any rate, by preserving the annalistic form he left us
tolerably clear as to his chronology. Not so Sallust. Throughout
the whole account of the war, we have but one definite date
given—the month of January in which, he says, Albinus made
his unfortunate winter expedition7. How vague and careless is
his use os interea, postremo, post paucos dies etc. may be seen
from his account of the events between Iugurtha’s return from
Spain and Micipsa's deathss. When we corne to the war itself,
we find ourselves in a hopeless difficulty. One can only mention

⁴ S. is fond of the vague accepiwm i), which he often uses in referring

to remote periods of history or distant regions (cp. Cat. 6. 1, Iug. 19. 5,
78. 1): in ¹3· 9 it is used in reference to Adherbal's speech.
