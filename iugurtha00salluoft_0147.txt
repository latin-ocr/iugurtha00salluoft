gentium is often referred to in connexion with the inviolability of
ambassadors: cp. 35. 7.

prohibuerit] though all the other subordinate clauses of this speech
are secondary. Such a change is common in Livy, and may be due to
love of variety, but even Caesar has examples.

5 utrique] 18. η n.

flowing in a deep ravine and is only accessible from the S.W., where a
nari-ow col joins it to the adjacent hills.

temptare] The object (eam, the city) must be supplied, as in ²9· ι.

equivalent os denique: cp. 30. 3, 66. 1, 76. 4.

uncommon meaning of the word, but cp. Liu. 2. 24. 2 alius alium

desperate for him to waste time in mere reviling, or else that the mere

fact that he is in this plight will prevent their believing anything he says
of Iug.
antea] referring to the events of ch. 14 sqq.

δ nisi etc.] There is here some laxity of construction: perhaps the use
is colloquial. Praetically‚ nisi=sed, but the speaker means: ‘ Ι won’t
say more, except this: that Ι see etc.’ for which correct Latin requires
nisi (hoc.) me intellegere. The same construction in 67. 3, 100. 5.

quam] as if supra were a comparative. It regularly follows ultra.
grauius] ‘ of more importance.'
