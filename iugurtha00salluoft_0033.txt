consul and corresponding to the tribunes of the legion. One
would also expect to find the ala, like the legion, divided into
companies of equal size, and it is generally assumed by modern
scholars¹ that it did contain 10 such companies, called cohortes.
If so, this kind of cohort must at least sometimes have been
distinct from the cohort described above, the contingent of a
community, for these (as there hinted) cannot all have been of
the same strength. The whole question is very uncertain, no
information being really accessible in the ancient writers: all
we do know is that to allied, and indeed all non-Roman infantry,
the word cohors is regularly applied in contra-distinction to the
legions and maniples of Rome2. The cavalry were divided‚
like those of Rome, into lnrmae3.

From the times of the Punic wars the Romans also used
the troops of foreign countrieS, especially those with which
they were warring or had warred. These men served generally
as mercenaries, and as light troops. The ernployment of this
kind of forces became more and more common: in the Iugurtha
we meet with Balearic slingms, Ligurian infantry, Numidian
and Thracian horse4.

According to some ancient authorities the terms auxilia,
auxiliarius applied strictly speaking to these foreign troops
alone, and was not used to denote the socii. Sallust however
uses auxilio, not only, for brevity's sake, to denote Italian and
foreign troops together, but even for those solely composed of
Italians5.

¹ Marquardt (St. V. 2. 398 sqq.) for example. He is anything but
clear and leaves it quite doubtful whether he reckons two kinds of
auxiliary cohort or not. The Dict. of Antiquities of course reproduces
his account.

² See 58. 5 (cohortes sociorum), 99. 1 (where cohortium and tur-
marum are opposed to legionum). See also notes 4 and 5 below.

³ See p. xxiii4.

⁴¹ Balearic slingers 105. 1 (cp. 49. 6, 94. 3, 100. ²), cohors ngrurum
38. 6, 77. 4, 100. 2, Numidian horse 68. 2, turmae Thracum 38. 6.

⁵ Thus, not only such expressions as 43. 4, 84. 2, but even ab sociis
et nomine Latino auxilia accersere 39. τ. This makes it impossible
