xxvi THE JUGURTHA OF SALLUST

general’s Council¹ and whose position was the highest to be
reached, under ordinary circumstances, by one who started in
the ranks. These chief centurions were osten great personages
in the provincial towns to which they retired on getting their
discharge. The first maniple of the hastati was called primus
(ordo) hastatus, the next secundus hastatus and so on2. Then
come primus princeps and the rest of the maniples of the
principes. The maniples of the triarii were called pili, so that
here we begin with primus pilus. As for the centurions in each
maniple‚ one probably ranked as superior to the other: this
was certainly so in the primus pilus, one of whose centurions
was the chief centurion of the legion referred to above3. In
battle, in earlier times at least, the troops stood in a triple line 3
first the hastati, then the princz'pes⁴‚ last the triarii: the first
two lines with the distinctive Roman javelin gpz'lmn), the rear
rank with the spear. But in Caesar's time all troops carried the
pilum, though the names of the three classes still remained to
denote the centuries. We know Marius introduced an improve-
ment in the construction of the 2527qu perhaps he extended

¹ So Polybius tells us. In Caesar we find the centurions of the
primi ordines admitted here, but it is quite uncertain what these words
mean. [It seems assumed that they cannot mean ‘first ceuturies of
each legion-’J

posterior: Liu. Le. cui primum lzaslalnm prioris centuriae aclslg’naret...
mihi primus princeps prioris centuriae est adszg'nalus. Yet Polybius
seems to carefully avoid saying that one of the two centurions com-
manded the maniple. In the case of the primus pilus matters are
complicated by the fact that we never find a primus pz'··'us prioris
cenlnrz'ae or a primus pilus peslerz'oris centuriae mentioned, but only the
prz'mztspilus. In later times it appears there was only one centurion
for it, but in earlier times the authorities regularly speak of 60
centurions.

¹² At a still earlier period the hastati doubtless came second, and
the principes meant what it should mean, ‘ men of the front rank)
