you...?’

m imperio] ‘in the enjoyment of': cp. 14. 11n., and our own
expression ‘born in the purple.'

12 et eidem] ‘ and at the same time‚' 9. 2 n.

honesta atque inhonesta] The stress is of course on inhonesta,
the whole expression simply meaning ‘everything’ It recurs 80. 5:
cp. ius et iniuriae 14. 16, 33. ‘z and Vergil'sfacta atque infecta canebat

celebrated case, in 494 B.C.‚ they resorted to the Mons Sacer; in the
last, in 287 B.C.‚ to the Ianiculum; z'n tlte second only, in 449, to the
Aventine. S„ who must. include in his bis the secessions of 494 and
449, has either made a slip in conducting them both to the Aventine
or has sacrifieed truth to brevity. In a fragment 01' the Histories (1. 9)
he himself describes the first secession as being to the Mons Sacer.
