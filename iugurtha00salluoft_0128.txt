4 bello Punico secundo] the great war of 218—202 in which Hannibal
invaded Italy but, aster gaining several victories (notably the decisive
one of Cannae in 216), was soiled by the evasive tactics of Q. Fabius
Maximus and, aster the defeat of his brother who was bringing rein-
sorceinents (in 207), was forced by Scipio’s invasion of Africa to return
thither. Here the decisive battle of Zama ended the war in Rome's
favour.

post] ‘since the beginning of....’ The magnitudo dates from 275
when the invadet Pyrrhus was finally repulsed at Beneventum.

Masinissa] fought for Carthage in Spain, but after a great victory of
Scipio's made overtures to him. On his return to Africa he was attacked
by his old neighbour and rival Syphax and the Carthaginians, but
Scipio's invasion of the country saved him. He commanded the right
wing at Zama.

Africano] is really in apposition to cui: cp. 79. 5 and R. 1059.

Syphace] see above.

led S. to combine adj. and adv. Take magnum predicatively, and tr.

5 sed] is often a mere connecting particle in S. [=6e‘]. to be rendered
‘n0w,’ or ‘and’: cp. 17. 3, 28. 6, 40. 5, 48. 3, 63. 3 (where it introduces
a digression). ‘Now his power (and so his friendly poliey) was ended
only by death) [If an adversative force for sed is thought necessary,
one may take it as marking the transition to circumstances less favour-
able to peaceful relations with Rome]

6 optinuit, ‘governed’; cp. 16. 2.

7 quem] refers to Iugurtha. priuatum: i.e. without any claim to the
throne.

cultu] manner oflife‚ education: 75. 1, 95. 2.
habult] ‘kept,’ ‘had him brought up.’

CHAPTER VI.

1 decora facie] is probably abl. of quality: cp. r. 1 n.
luxu] the old sorni os the dative. [Almost all our good MSS. have
luxui, but those os two late writers who cite this passage have preserved
the old fortir]
2 paruis liberis] abl. absolute, parallel to exacta sua aetate.
negotio] The word is often used by S. as equivalent to res, with,
however, the idea of difficulty, or, as here, danger.
