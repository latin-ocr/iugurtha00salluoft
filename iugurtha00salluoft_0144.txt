umque alteris] the plural of these words regularly means ‘each
party,' or ‘each set of cases.' Cp. 13· 9, 22. 5, 42. 4, 53. 7, 60. 1 etc.
One might have expected alteri sor utrique (as in the last three exx.
cited). The parties are the parent stock of ἓ 7 and the emigrants of§ 11.

inferior] lower lying, the part towards the Mediterranean: cp.
super 19. 5.

pleraque] S. affects the sing. of this word (54. 9, 79. 2, 85. 21): do
not imitate.

concessere] ‘passed into,’ ‘ were merged in.'

CHAPTER XIX.

sollicitata...auidis] refers only to the pars and shews how they set to
work. Sollicitam must be taken with both plebe and auidis.

Hipponem...1.eptim] Each of these names was borne by two cities:
here where he appears to be naming cities in the immediate vicinity of
Carthage, Hzppo Zm-ytm and the so-called Leptis minor are probably
meant.

originibus] ‘mother cities.’

nam] ‘1 do not mention Carthage‚ for....' Nam osten gives the
reason sor a thought which is not expressed : cp. 82. 2, 88. 5, 102. 11.

parum] ‘inadequately.’

ad] seems to mean ‘ starting at.'

seeundo mari] lit. ‘with the sea following,’ i.e. keeping the sea by
you, keeping along the coast.

Theraeon]= θηραίων, a Gk. gen. pL: cp. Philaenon just below. Thera
was one of the Cyclades.

ac deinceps] One would hardly gather from S.'s description that
the order is (ι) Greater Syrtis, (2) Philaenon arae, (3) Leptis, (4) Lesser
Syrtis. His love of brevity is to blame: when he came to (ι) he thought

he would at once explain that there were two Syrtes and that Leptis came
between them.

Leptis] sc. magna, as distinct from Leptis of§ 1.
Philaenon] see ch. 79.

Hispania] 18. 11 n.

super] ‘inland of : ’ cp. inferior 18. 12. So post just below.

igitur] as osten, is resumptive: ⁴ to come back to the war.’ Cp. 4²· 4, Δ

49. 1, 64. 1, 86. 4, 96. Ι.
