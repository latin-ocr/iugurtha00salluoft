procurationem] Compare the grovelling language of Masinissa's

ambassador iu Liu. 45. ¹3· 15: Mzsinissam usu regni contentane scire
dominium et ius eorum qui dederint csse.

militiae] a locative, like donzi. The use of it, as in 84. 2, ,
without the other locative, is rare, but cp. the use of belli (41. 7 n.).

esse] aster eniterer: see 17. 1 n.

cognatorum] depends on in...locum. The order is bold, but not
too bold for S.: cp. 78. 2.

‘m adfinium locum ducerem] ‘set you in the place of.’ Ducere
in this meaning generally takes the ablative (with or without in), but
the other construction is quite possible, as the word easily implies
motion. So referre and ponere are found taking in and the acc. t cp. too
in prouinciam...c0nl0cat 61. 2. Probably the metaphoris a bookkeeping
one, in which case cp. 85. 26, 111. 1. [The (in) adfinium loco os certain

amicus the Romans implied recognition of a king’s title: cp. 24. 3,
77. 2, 104. 4, and sor such recognition 65. 2.

3 atque] ‘ now.’

uenturus eram] ‘ was doomed to.'

uellem ete] A good example of S.'s love of variety. The verb
takes (1) a directly dependent subj.,possem (cp. 24. 9), (2) an acc. and
ins„ deberi benificia, (3) an ut clause, uti uterer.

maxume] ‘above all,’ ‘ if possible' as the best thing, as opposed to
secundum ea: cp. 35. 4, 46. 4 [μάλιστα μέν]. ‘ Ι should like Rome to
owe me favours, but myself not to require them.’

secundum ea...u†.erer] ‘short of this (lit. ‘next to this')‚ I would
wish that, if I must require them, I could feel I was enjoying favours
that were my due.’ With debitis of course supply beng'ficizlv.

4 in manu fuit] i.e. I have not the power to make him a good
character. Cp. ἓ 13, 31. 5 and Ter. Hec. 667 uxor quid faciat, z'n
manu non est mea.

5 in suis dubiis rebus] It would be difficult to adduce an example
where in such a case Rome admitted them to an alliance.

bello carthaginiensi] 5. 4 n.

mag-is fides eius quam fortuna petunda erat] S. has sacrificed
clearness to the charms os brevity and alliteration. He means: it was
rather the knowledge that Rome was a loyal ally and would help them in
their hour of need that was the attraction, than her actual position at the
