1 proellis] fought by his own force and that of Rutilius.

more militlae] Such gifts were the coronae (e.g. the civica awarded to
the man who saved a Roman's lise in battle), various decorations (such
as the phalerae, consisting of metal discs strung on a piece of leather.
sor the adornment of horse and man: so 85. 29), spears (ib.), and
vexilla (ib.).

ἓ 6 below)].

fuga] ‘ rout ³ as in 39. 5.
5 ex] ‘in subservience to... 'z 40. 5 n.
detrimento] may be parsed as abl. of price or that of attendant
circumstances.
6 temere] ‘ carelessly.’
ea formidine] 36. 1n.

’1 suis] 9. 2 n.

8 quippe] must not be taken with cuius which is antecedent to the
subject of cogebatur.
