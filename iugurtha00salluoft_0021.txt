INTRODUCTJON Δ xv

a few points here. It is quite clear that the siege near the
Muluccha of ch. 92 must have happened in the year after the
expedition to Capsa of ch. 89 sqq. For the latter took place
at the end of the summer¹, and a glance at the map will shew
the distance between the Muluccha and Capsa. Yet Sallust
certainly leads us to suppose that both events belonged to the
same year2, saying not a word about Marius' having withdrawn
into winter quarters, as he does later on (aster the Muluccha
expedition3). Even the one definite date referred to above gives
trouble. Albinus’ defeat, he says, took place in Januaaey. Now
on the [st of January the consuls for the year must have been
elected, or, if they were not, they would necessarily enter office
the moment they were. In other words the term deszgnali could
not be applied to them4. Yet we are told that aster Aulus'
disaster the ‘consules designati' drew lots for their provinces⁵.
Here chronology, or knowledge of simple constitutional law, is
at fault. Sallust osten errs in this last respectss. But the fact is,
he does not wislz to be accurate or to give a good account of
the war. Otherwise, could he have omitted to say how it was
that Cirta, whose capture by Iugurtha brought about the
declaration of war, was in Metellus' hands towards the end of
his term of office7?

There remains the question : was Sallust, apart from tempta-
tions of rhetoric, as impartial as he claims to be3? It is believed
by some scholars that he wrote this work as a glorification
of Marius, the uncle of his favourite Caesar. Yet he does not
hesitate to refer to the darker episodes of his hero's career9,
and shew clearly enough how his successes were sometimes due

arrive until ch. 95, though of course he must have followed Marius to his
province without any long delay.
