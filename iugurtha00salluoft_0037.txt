Metellus’ second campaign (74—83)‚ in which he takes
Thala (75, 76) and garrisons Leptis (77—79) and forces
lug. to ally himself with Bocchus (80, 81), but on
hearing that he is superseded by Mancinus' lawl takes
no further active measureS.

107 Marius, as consul, admits all Romans to the legions and
crosses to Africa. Finding the enemy unwilling to
meet him he marches to Capsa late in the summer²
and takes it (84-91). During thisyear lze must have
been joined by Sulla (95. 1): winter-quartem are
not mentioned by S.3

[106⁴] Marius marches to the neighbourhood of the Muluccha
and takes a fortress (92. 5—94). On his way back to
winter-quarters he is twice attacked by the combined
forces of lug. and Bocchus (97—99‚ 101). Sulla inter-
views the latter, without immediate result (102).

XVinter-quarters in the coast towns (100. 1, 103. 1).
Marius takes the turris regia and grants a request
from Bocchus to give his envoys sase conduct to Rome:
they receive encouragement from the senate (103, 104).

the result that lug. is at length treacherously surrendered
to that officer (105—113).

¹ 82. 2 compared with 73. 7. Exactly when this law passed we cannot
say, as we do not know whether Mancinus was tribune from Dec. 10,
¹09 or Dec. 10, 108 onwards.

² aestans extremum erat 90. 1.

³ For these points see p. xv.

⁴ See p. xv.

⁶ Here again we are passing imperceptibly into the year 105, as
the allusion to the battle of Arausio as taking place per idem tempus
(114. 1) shews. Cp. p. xxxii‘* above.
