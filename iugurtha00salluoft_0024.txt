xviii THE JUGURTHA OF SALLUST

person plural of the perfect, diu noctuque, and so forth: also
the rare nequitur, the form comperior and the active forms of
a good many verbs that are generally deponents. Besides
this, the spelling is throughout that of an early period.

ΙΙ. Brevity.

This feature of Sallust’s style is referred to by the ancients
even more frequently than his lovesof archaisms, sometimes
simply by speaking of his brem'las, sometimes by longer
explanatory expressions, such as nz'lzz'l demi sine detrimento
sensus potest1; amputatae sententiae et uerba ante exspectatum
cadentia& abruptum sermonis genus& The reference seems in
the main to the brevity of his sentences, his complete disregard
for the period4. The editors cite also his ellipses (especially
of the verb sum) and his asyndeta. To these may be added
his free use of the present participle where the best writers
employ a dependent clause, and of appositional phrases instead
of relative sentences. See also Index under ‘Brevity,' ‘Sym-
metry' and ‘Zeugma' As definite examples of compression of
thought one may select the famous description of Hiempsal's
death, where the assassins find his hiding place and—carry his
head to Jugurtha5; or sentences like 100. 4 (ipse armatus
intentusque item milites cogebat), and above all 112. 3 ‘a
man of high birth would not be left—through no fault of his
own, but on the contrary in the service of the state—in the
enemy's hands) This last example exhibits the fault that
commonly attends on brevity—obscurity: another example of
this is to be found in his rapid ¹survey of the African coast of

¹ Sen. Contr. 9. 1. 13. 2 Sen. Ep. 114. 16.

⁸ Quint. 4. α. 45. Other passages will be found in Teuffel 206. 6.

4 The second passage quoted clearly refers to this: cp. Cic. Or. 168
sqq. where he speaks of the older writers who did not use the period
(conclusio), and the expression apte uerba cecidissent of ἕ 168 is opposed
to infracta et ampulata loquuntur of§ 170. So Quint. 10. 2. 17 speaks
of imitators of Thucydides and Sallust praecisis conclusionibusobscuri.
The endings of both the Catiline and the Iugurtha are very abrupt.

⁵ 12. 6.
