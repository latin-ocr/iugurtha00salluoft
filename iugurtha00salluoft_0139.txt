NOTES 99

fingere me] The acc. and inf. depends on a verb of saying evolved
from niti etc. 8. 1 n.

uerba] ‘mere words,’ ‘idle tales‚’ as opposed to res. Cp. the
common uerba dare ‘to deceive.’

0111] of course refers to me, and will be tr. ‘though Ι could have.’
Notice the Latin sor ‘I could have done this': the past tense is given
by the finite verb: mz'ln‘ licuit lzoc facere, not licet fecisse.

21 quod] the adversative conjunction‚ ‘ but‚' as in quod si etc.

simulantem] in bitter irony, ‘pretending as much as Ι am,' i.e.
‘ really suffering.’

ne] ‘ assuredly ’ (the e being long). Cp. 85. 20.

reddat] is really apodosis to the protasis utinam uideam.

22 unde] as often=a quo.

laetandum...casum] implies the possibility of saying laelor casum,
which is indeed Latin, but not to be imitated: the abl. or a preposition
usually follows.

23 rerum humanarum spectaculum] ‘ au object lesson of (the mutability
oi) men’s fortunes.’ Cp. 38. 9, and esp. 104. 2.

cujus] refers to Adherbal and is subj. gen.‚ as uitae necisque are
obj. gen.‚ with potestas. ‘My power. to spare life or inflict death‚’
i.e. my power as a king.

alienis] that is, of Rome.

24 Tr. ‘Would that death were an honourable way of escape for such
a position as mine, and that people would not think Ι deserved all the
insults I have received if I thus submitted to my wrongs.’ The only
difficulty is that iniuriae concedere would more naturally be used of
swallowing one's pride and living on. [Hence some adopt the reading
of certain MSS. uiuere sor zsure and take neu to introduce an alternative,
‘or else, would that Ι could go on living, resigning all hope of revenge.'
But neu in S. always introduces not an alternative, but a clause explain-
ing or expanding what has preceded. And the clause before does need

explanation, for there was nothing dishonourable in suicide to the mind
os the ancients.]

nunc] ἕ 17 n.
25 per uos] a verb of appealing must be supplied: cp. 10. 3 per hanc
' dextram moneo obleslorque te.

familiae nostrae] a rather loose gen.‚ ‘which rage in ': cp. Romae
Numidiaeque facinora 3 3. 4.
