xxviii THE JUGURTJIA Off SALLUST

communities allied with Rome (and soremost among them the
Latin colonies¹)‚ had to supply troops, infantry and cavalry,
according to the terms os the treaty between them and the
Capital. The actual levying was left to them: each community
sent its contingent (εοΙιονεῖ) under a native commander (prae-
fi'cfus) to a rendez-vous appointed by the consul. The force
thus raised did not form an independent army, but was attached
to the consular ones: to each consular army, consisting normally
of 8400 infantry and 600 cavalry, we find in the books of Livy
dealing with the first half of the second century B.C. allied
troops added to the amount of 10 to 15 thousand infantry, and
5 to 8 hundred cavalry. The tendency to require more men
from the allies than they supplied themselves grew with the
Romans—especially when their own cavalry began to be useless.
Polybius in his account of the Roman camp says that the
number of the allied cavalry was three times that of the Roman.
This pressure of military service upon them was of course one
of the grievances that brought on the great Italian war of
the next century3. In the battle-line the socii fought on the
flanks, and the force sor a consular army was accordingly
divided into two alae—left and right wings. Each ala was
under six praefecti socium4, Roman officers appointed by the

1 Hence socii et nomen (notumque) Lalz'num 39. 2, 43. 4 and (quite
exceptionally) Latium et socii 95. 1. The full expression os 40. 2
homines nominis Latini et socios Italicos is also very unusual.

³ Especially as their position in the army was one of inferiority.
Prona-azio, the right of appeal against a capital sentence was open to
the lowest Roman soldier, but not to the Latin officer, as the case
os Turpilius shews (ch. 69). [On the other hand Ι do not think it has
been noted that this man had received great power from the general,
being (as 66. 3 shews) in command over the Roman tribunes.]

4 That they were 6 in number, not 3, is probable in itself and,
Ι believe with Mommsen (St. R. {- 675), consistent with Polybius’
account. These praefecti socium are apparently called pr. cohortium

in 46. 7—unless indeed the native commanders referred to above are
there meant.
