CnAP'rER CIII.

1 praesidium] is in apposition to perfugas, ‘as a guard.
2 rursus] he returned to his plans of 102. 2.
reputando...admonitus] note the variation, and sor the abl. of the
gerund see on 70. 2.
aliis] i.e. than those of 102. 15.
3 placeat] :placebit os Or. Recta sce on 8. 1.
quocumque] =quouis, a usage not to be imitated: until Livy it
seems limited (in prose) to the abl. sing. of the word.
4 sine decore] ‘in a sorry plight.’

pro praetore] 36. 4 n.

βουλόμενα, in a passive sense ‘desired by.’ Ι am not at all sure that S.
may not have allowed himself to use beniuolentia in the sense ‘she-ming

the head of utilia]

CHAPTER CIV.

1 quo intenderat] ²5· 10 n. He captured the turris regia of 103. ῐ.
[ab Tucca] There were three towns of the name in Africa: the one
referred to here must be the one which Pliny describes as impositum
mari et flumini Ampsagae. We know that MarIus meant to quarter his
