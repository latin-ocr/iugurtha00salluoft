INTRODUCTJON xxvii

its use to all files, but this is not certain, and there is nothing
in the Iugurtha to prove how they were armed at the time of
this war. For marching and other purposes three maniples
(one of each class) were sometimes grouped together to form
a separate unit, to which the name of cohort was given. In
Caesar's time indeed this cohor-t, and not the manime, was the
regular fighting unit. Doubtless with enemies like the Gau1s,
who relied on at once shattering the Roman line, it was found
necessary to strengthen its unit. In the Iugurtha we find the
manipular arrangement still in force under Metellusl: cohorts
are however mentioned as being detached, in battle or other-
wise, for special purposes2.

The only other body of Roman troops to be found in the
army was the general's bodyguard—cohors praetoria, introduced,
we are told, by the younger Scipio. The word cohors implies
that it consisted, at least mainly, of infantry: Scipio and Marius
however seem to have preferred cavalryss. One authority tells
us that Scipio selected for this duty his friends and clients‚
another says that he chose the bravest men of the army.
Evidently the immediate claims of friendship counted before
the remote ones of ultimate safety: Sallust implies that Marius
was an exception in selecting his guard with regard to their
courage. This institution developed greatly in later times,
eventually becoming the Praetorian Guard of Imperial times.

W‘henever a levy was held, the various socii, or Italian

javelin stuck in the shield of an enemy the wooden nail would break
and the iron one would bend, and the heavy wooden shast instead of
standing straight out would hang down and eneumber the man.

² 51. 3 (posted ‘against the enemy’s infantry ‘), 100. 4 (sent ex-
cubitum in portas). cohortes expeditae are thrice mentioned, but are
perhaps not legionary eohorts at all (contrast expediti manipuli in
100. 2). In 55. 4, 56. 3 the simple cohortes tells us nothing, except
that infantry are meant.

familiam'ssumis parauerat 98. 1).
