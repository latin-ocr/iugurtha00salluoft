xxii THE JUGURTHA OF SALLUST

were mainly those of a paymaster‚ but he reckoned as second
in command and it was he, not one of the legates, who regularly
represented the chief in his absence. Marius, coming in hot
haste to Africa, leaves his quaestor behind to collect cavalry
and follow after¹.

The levy however was not in the hands of legates or
quaestor, but was conducted by the tribum· militmn2. The
Roman legion had not, until the time of Caesar, a fixed com—
mander. Its highest officers were the six tribunes, colleagues
of absolutely equal powers, which they exercised by dividing
themselves into three pairs and delegating the chief authority
to each pair for two months, The tribunes of the four legions
regularly raised were magistrates, elected by the comitia³‚ like
the consuls themselves, for a single year. In Polybius' tirne
a candidate must have seen at least five years’ service, and
something of the kind was probably still required in Cicero’s
time. We then find men of good birth beginning their career
by serving‚ nominally as common soldiers, but really as ‘order-
lies’ or the like, in close attendance on the general or some
officer os high rank. This is the contubernium (lit. ‘living in
the same tent ') in which we find the younger son of Metellus
at the time when Marius wished to stand for the consulship, and
it probably gave the right to become a candidate for the
tribunate4.

On the day appointed for the levy the tribunes, after deciding

² See 29. 4, 95. 1, 103. 4. In the last passage Sulla is left as
Marius’ representative. It was perhaps part of Spurius Albinus' crime
that he lest his brother instead (36. 4).

² Officially a defining genitive (militum, or legionum as in 46. 7), or

the adjective militaris (66. 3), was necessary to distinguish them from
the far more important tribuni plebis. Other reff. to tribunes: 59. 1,
60. 1, 100. 2.

³ Hence the full title tr. mil. a populo (cp. 63. 4). If more than
four legions were enrolled, the consuls, not the people, appointed their
tribunes: these were not magistrates and were not a populo.

much the same purpose.
