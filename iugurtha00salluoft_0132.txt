92 SALLUSJJ JUGURTHA

CHAPTER X.

1 111. regnum...accepi] recognised as a successor ε cp. 11. 6, 22. 2. Os
course he had not done so until Iug. was grown up (9. 3), but pretends
that it had been his intention all along (cp. 5. 7).

genuissem] 8. 1 n. : he thought ‘si genuero!

ob benificia] is an explanatory addition, applying only to tibi (not
to liberis) carumfore. Tr. ‘in your case, because of the kindnesses....’

falsum.. ¹habuit] Generally where habeo and a past participle passive
are conjoined, the verb means ‘ keep’ or ‘consider' or ‘get 't cp. the
phrase compertum habere and in Cicero inclusum habere, deportatas
habere. Here however, as in one or two other passageS, it is difficult
to see wherein the expr. differs from fifi’llz't.

2 meque regnumque] Intr. p. xvii: outside S. que...que... is confined
to poetry. Cp. 21. 4, 79. 9, 85. 47, 100. 5, 110. 8, and 26. 1 n.

in Hispania] Masinissa had fought there: 5. 4 n.
inuidiam uicisti] 6. 1 cum omnis gloria anteiret, omnibus tamen
carus esse.

3 dexteram] the right hand was given in bargains etc. as a pledge of
truth and is osten appealed to, as the outward symbol of a man’s honour.
Of course it is Iugurtha's hand.

regul fidem] is a very obscure phrase, meaning, I think, ‘the loyalty
due to the kingdom' of which the speaker had given him a share.
Cp. 24. 10 wherefides amicitiae is ⁴ loyalty due to friendship)
propinqui] being his cousins.

4 parare] ‘buy,’ a not uncommon meaning of the word, preserved in

the modern Italian comprare (comparare): cp. 31. 11, 33. 2, 35. 4.
queas] potential subj.: cp. 60. 4 and R. 1544.

5 hostis] a strong word intentionally substituted for inimicus.

6 equidem] here simply an emphatic particle, as osten in S. (e.g.
85. 26). He has however the other use (zego quidem).

7 ante] ‘more than,’ ‘rather than,’ lit. ⁴ sooner than.’ Ante aliquem
esse, ‘to surpaSS‚' is not uncomrnon, but I do not know of any example
quite like this.

qui...es] Most Latin writers would put sis (aster qui causal) but
S. affects the indicative (Intr. p. xvii). ⁸
opulentior est] ‘ has more resource5.'

8 liberos] As M. had adopted only one son, S. is sacrificing a little
to his desire for brevity.
