NOTES Ι75

would at first suppose it referred to diem decumum. So in ιιι. 1 lum
was impossible, because of the following tum.
4 sanctus] 85. 40 n.
ex sententia] sor the phrase sce on 38. 4, sor its use as an adjective
28. 1.

CHAPTER CX.

2 nullius] probably depends on ope (or opis) understood.
3 id] his independence, just described.
inminutum] cp. 81. 4.
fuerit mihi etc.] ‘let this loss of independence which has at length
come upon me be the price for (i.e. ‘buy me’) your friendship’: 1 am
ready to put up with the loss of my old position if it secures me your
sriendship. Fuerit is jussive, implying ‘1 am ready for it to l›e.'
4 adeo] is simply emphatic, as often with pronouns: cp. e.g. 111. 1.
integra] ‘fresh,’ ‘unpaid.’
6 finis meos] he keeps to the tale of 102. 13.

8 flumen] is used loosely sor the territory bounded by the river: hence
egrediar and intrare.

intrare] as a means of escape.

CHAPTER CXI.

1 multis] ‘at length': so paucis osten (eg. 110. 6).

quod polliceretur] is object to habituros, ‘his promising)

in gratiam habituros] sor the acc. see on 14. 1. Habere does not
obviously imply motion (hence e.g. 103. 6 in bcnzggrnitate habebantur)
but it easily acquires it: see e.g. 1 12. 3 where in potestatem habere means
‘get into one's power.' And the analogy of such verbs as duco, pono in
similar metaphors would help. [As an actual fact, unless we entirely
reject the authority of Gellius, the Romans constructed even esse thus:

in such cases of course it would have the pregnant force of ‘come
to be.⁷]

illorum...sua retulisse] R. 1285.

adeo] 1 ιο. 4n.

copiam] ‘access to’: so in Plautus and Terence.
tradidisset] 8. ιη.

quam nunc peteret] in reference to his remarks in 110. 6 (see
there).

ultro] 8. πη.
