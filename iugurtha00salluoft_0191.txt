NOTES 15 1

CHAPTER LXXIX.

1 rem nos...admonuit] for double aec. cp. 49. 6.

2 pleraque Africa] local abl. With the name of a country classical
usage would require a preposhion, but this does not seem to have been
the case in old and colloquial Latin (e.g. Plautus is quite lax in the
matter), and Sallust has elsewhere written tu [Mesopotamia nos Armenia
circumgredimur exercimm (Hist. fr. 4. 61. 21). Cp. also 28. 6. &Ne
find the same tendency in Tacitus. [Most MSS. read Africae, but a
4th cent. grammarian tells us that S. wrote the abl. here.] For the
sing. pleraque see on 18. 12.

cyrenenses] 19. 3.

3 habuit] ‘kept.'

4 legiones] ‘armies‚' as in Plautus, Ennius and poets: cp. Hor. S.
1. 6. 4 magnis legionibus.

alteri alteros] 18. 12 n.
legati] of each state: hence the sing. domo.
inter se] 53. 7 n.
5 Philaenis] dative: see 5. 4 n.
pergere] with any object but iter is very rare, nor is this phrase
itself common.

6 ceterum] but it need not have been socordia, for as a matter of fact....

atque] 15. 1n.

nuda] here takes a gen. : the abl. is the usual constr. So in 90. 1
he has the only example in Latin of uacuos with a gen.

gignentium] pres. part. (neuter gender) of gignor used as a ‹le-
ponent, meaning ‘I grow.’ Cp. the occasional use of uelzens to mean
‘riding’ or ‘driving'z in this case uelzo ‘I carry’ gives uehar ‘I arn
carried' and then a deponent uehar ‘ Ι ride,' which os course has a pres.
part. (cp. e.g. moriens etc.). The use recurs 93. 4.

'1 aliquanto posteriores] If the altars afterwards built (ἓ 10 below)
were erected on the spot where they met, the deputies of Cyrene were
very much behindhand, for the geographers reckon these arae as So miles
from that town and 180 from Carthage !

conruptam] ‘ruined,' rather like our colloquial ‘make a rness of.²
domi] :an adj.: cp. lzuvripabulum 18. 1 n.
conturbare rem] ‘confuse the point at issue)

8 Graeci] Cyrene was a colony from Thera (19. 3) in the Greek

archipelagO.
