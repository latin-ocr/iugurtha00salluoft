xxx THE IUGURTHA OF SALLUST

Of the Roman army as a working force this book of Sallust
gives a vivid picture, ancl to it Ι refer the reader who has
accompanied me in the examination of its constituent parts.
There, apart from the pitched battles and stormings¹‚ and
surprises2‚ we may learn the nature and uses of their storm
and siege appai·atus³‚ and note the care with which their best
generals conducted their marches4 and managed their camps⁵-—
the latter perhaps the most characteristic of all their institu-
tione—These are the points of which Polybius remarks with
such enthusiasm: ‘I cannot imagine anyone so indifferent to
noble things, to really important things, as to refuse to take
a little extra trouble to understand matters whose nature is
such that, if once he hears them, he will know one of those
things that are really worth knowing.’ And the excellence
of that army and. its system is attested by the imitation
with which their enemies, including Iugurtha himself, paid it
the highest of tributesG. Not only he, but Arminius and
Tacfarinas learnt how to fight Rome's legions by service in
her army. And the conflict in which Rome and the Italy
whose warriors she had trained at length engaged, was a
conflict in which neither of the combatants were defeated.

to say uliat he means by cohorlcs auxiliariae (87. 1, 93. 2) or equites
auxz'lsam'z· (46. 7, 90. 2, 100. 4), which may signify either non-Italian
or non-Roman troops.
