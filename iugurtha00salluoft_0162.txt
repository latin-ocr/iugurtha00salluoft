122 SALLUST, JUGURTJJA

2 partium inuidia] ‘ party hatred, ⁹ the gen. being subjective or objective.
Forpartes cp. 41. 1, 73. 4.
quin...faterentur] ‘without admitting‚’ R. 1696.
per homines nominis Latini et. socios 1talicos inpedimenta
parabant] A characteristically vagire expression. The Latius and
other Italians could not take part in the voting. But they could
influence it in various ways: many of them would be capitalists and
wealthy traders, and others could help to cause riots and break up
assemblies. Cp. also on 4²- 1. [Latins seem to have had the privilege
of voting in the comitia, but they all had to vote in a single one of
the divisions, so that the power they exercised at thern was a negligible
quantity (Momms. St. R. 3. 643).]
3 plebes] sor the order, cp. 13. 6n.
lubido] ‘passion.'
4 supra] 25· 4, etc.
fugam] ‘panic’; this metaphorical use is rare. So we speak of a
party being beaten all along the line.
trepida] The confusion made it possible for such a mistake to
be made.
rogarentur] ²9· 7.
5 sed] connects: 5. 5n.
ex rumore] i.e. the accused were at the mercy of hearsay evidence
and the caprice of the mob (ex is ‘in conformity with’ as in 42. 4, 54. 5,
61. 3: cp. 38. 4n.). We know from Cicero that Bestia, Sp. Albinus
and Opimius (16. 2) were among the condemned.

CHAPTER XLI.

1 ceterum] introduces a digression: so he osten uses sed.
mos] ‘practice⁷: we should say ‘evil.'
partium popularium] the democratic party ; factionum, the various
eliques of the aristocratic party (8. 1 n.). [Some edd. omit popularium,
so that the whole phrase means ‘party feeling and the clique system.’]
quae] refers to rerum, but is attracted to the gender of the predicate
prima: cp. Cat. 7. 6 eas diuitias, eam bonam famam putabant. So
75. 6, 85. 30 below, and see 79. 8η.
ducunt] ‘deem'z cp. 76. 6.
2 carthaginem deletam] in 146 B.c.: ¹3· 4n.
modeste] ‘discreetly‚' neither side seeking undue power.
