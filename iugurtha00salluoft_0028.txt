xxiv THE JUGURTJJA OF SALLUST

were sometimes employed to form a guard of honour to foreign
princes whose dignity Rome wished to recognisel. Perhaps
this was one of the stages through which these corps passed
to actual disbandment. There is however, another passage2
where Sallust may be referring to Roman cavalry, and if so
they were evidently even then used in the old way. He tells
us that Metellus marched in the van, Marius with cavalry in
the rear, and azcxz'liary cavalry were stationed on the flanks.
This certainly implies that the cavalry with Marius was Roman.
It may however have been that which was furnished by the
Italian alliesss. It is worth noting that Sallust never names the
decuriones or leaders of the legionary cavalry, though he does
mention cavalry leaders in general terms4. If these separate
legionary contingents did survive till Marius' time, he was just
the man to delight in breaking up so aristocratic an institution.

The cavalry enrolled, each tribe was called up in order
settled by lot, and a certain number of its men chosen to serve
and divided equally between the legions⁶. When the full tale
of the latter was made up (numbers varied, but 4200 probably
represents the average), proceedings closed with the administra-
tion of the oath to the rnen: one soldier from each legion
actually took this, the rest being simply called up in turn to
say the words idem in me.

In Polybius' time a legion contained four different classes
of infantry. The Triarii (the oldest troops) were always 600
in number: the rest of the legion consisted of equal numbers
of Principes (the next in age to the Triarii), Hastati, ancl
Velites (the poorest citizensss). The Velites were an institution
adopted when, in the Hannibalic war, the legionary cavalry were

⁵ From Liu. 4²· 35, I gather the centurions were appointed before
this. But Polybius says this was done some time aster the levy.⁰

⁶ The common soldier, legionary or otherwise, is called gregarius.
For ‘officer’ the Romans had no word.
