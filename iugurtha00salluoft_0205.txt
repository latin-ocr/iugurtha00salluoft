NOTES 165

otio luxurioso] is of course an abl. of quality, where we should say,
‘addicted to ease.'

nisi quod] ‘except that.’ The force of the next clause is not quite
clear. Literally the meaning is· ‘except that a more honourable (discreet)
course might have been taken as regards his wife,' or, as uxore may be
collective, and Sulla married five times, ‘his wives.’ Whether S. is
charging him with infidelity or the readiness with which ‘he availed
himself of the sacilities which Roman law offered for divorce is quite
uncertain. For consuli, which is of course impersonal, see on ¹3· 8.

et] ‘and yet' (so not a case like 11. 8).

amicma] is probably ablative, ‘ready to give his sriendship.'

negotia] is a mere equivalent for res, the whole phrase standing sor
ad simulandum.

4 felicissumo] He assumed the surname of Ε’ίιῖν.

ante ciuilem uictoriam] With the punctuation adopted in the
text, these words qualify felicissumo. S. refuses to call him felix aster
his victory, owing to the cruelty with which he revenged himself upon
men who, though his enemies, were nevertheless fellow citizens. Cp.
Cic. Phil. 2. 64 Caesar Alexandrea se recepit, felix, ut sibi quidem
uidebatur: mea autem sententia, qul rei publicae sit hostis, felix esse
nemo potest. [Modern edd. seem to prefer to make it qualify numquam
...fuit‚ but did not Sulla⁷s industria match his prosperity even aster his
victory—at least until he laid down his dictatorship?]

super...fu1t] ‘surpassed’z cp. 64. 2 supe-r fortunam animum
gereret.

CHAPTER XCVI.

1 igitur] resumes the narrative ε 19. 7 n.
Afficam...castra] i.e. first the province and then the camp.
2 ad hoc] ‘moreover, besides’: 2. 2 n.
1111] the debtors, quam plurumi being predicative, ‘that those who
owed him money should be as numerous as possible.'
3 atque] 1 1. 8 n.
multus] 84. ι n.
quod...solet] sc. facere. Generally fieri has to be supplied : see
on 15. 5. γ
4 artibus] ‘ qualities,’ as so often in S.
