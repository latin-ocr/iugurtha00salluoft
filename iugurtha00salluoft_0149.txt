NOTES 109

e metu atque lubidine] with agitabatur.
diuersus] divided between them: ep. 46. 4.

'1 paruisset] subj. of virtual Or. Obl. : for the tense cp. 8. 1 n. Here
of course there is no actual acc. and infi: the apodosis is implied in
the object of the verb of fearing: cp. 75. 2, R. 1750.

porro] ‘and then against

9 casumJ=occasionem (so 56. 4): do not imitate.

10 intenderat] latendo is a savourite with S. in the sense of ‘aim,’
‘purpose.’ He construets it with an object (noun or infinitive), or a
word like quo denoting direction: cp. 64. 1, 74. 1, 92. 6, 102. 1, 104. 1,
107. 7. For another sense of it, see 75. 8.

ut...pot1·1etur] explains quod.

11 senati] cp. 40. 1, R. 399. It is hardly an archaism, as Quintilian

movement represented by e.g. Gellius}

consumpta] regularly used of spending to no purpose: cp. e. g. 93. 1.

CHAPTER XXVI.
1 Italici] 21. ¹2.
deditione faeta] is equivalent to si deditio facta essa, and belongs
to the acc. and inf. clause.
seque et] Que...et is avoided by Caesar and Cicero, but cp. 5 5. 1,
89. 7, 9¹· 2, 104. 1. See on 10. 2.
de ceteris etc.] suadent here passes into the meaning ⁶ assure' and
so takes the construction of a verb of saying: 8. 1 n.
3 armatus] if right, impli& that the inhabitants, when they saw the
town was being treated like one taken by storin, in spite of the deditio,
took up arms. There is however fair authority for armatis.

CHAPTER XXVII.

1 ministri] contemptuously, os the Romans who had taken his bribes:
cp. 25. 2 and 3.
grafia] ‘personal influence.’
ueniebant] ‘tried to....⁷
