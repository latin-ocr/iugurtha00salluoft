110 SALLUST, JUGURTHA

in 100 A.D. he stood sor the consulship in their interest and paid for his
temerity with his life. A band of ruffians‚ hired by the revolutionary
party, with which Marius had allied himself, suddenly fell upon him
and beat him to death.

tribunus plebis] The tribunam, originally established to protect
the plebs from the patriciam, was now one of the most powerful state
magistracies, and yet could be held by men long before they were eligible
even for the praetorship. It was the recognised post from which to
start a revolution and was utilised by both of the Gracchi sor that
purpose. It was even as tribune that Rienzi came forward nearly
fifteen centuries later to protect the people from the nobles.

designatus] Magistrates were generally elected some time before
their term of office began: in the interval they were styled designati.
As such they enjoyed certain privileges otherwise peculiar to magistrates:
whether they had, as S. certainly implies‚ the right of addressing the
people is doubtful. [See Mommsen St. R. 1. 591⁶]

id agi ut] is simply the passive of id agere ut, ‘to do one’s best to....'
Tr. ‘the object aimed at was that....‘

Iugurthae] dative.

dilapsa] ‘evaporated.'

3 lege Sempronia] a law passed by C. (Sempronius) Gracchus in 123,
enacting that the senate, before the consuls were elected, should fix two
provinces for them to govern. After election, the consuls decided (by
lot or arrangement) which of the two each should have (cp. 43. 1).
Fuluris then does not mean desz'gyzatis, bnt ‘those who should be
elected.'

Italia] In the designation of Italy as a prouincia we see a clear
trace of the original force of that word—sphere of activity specially
assigned to a magistrate by law, decree of the senate, or the like.
A ‘province‚' in the ordinary sense of the word, Italy was not.
Sometimes we find it assigned to both consuls, when their presence
is not needed elsewhere. Contrast 35. 4, where trouble in Macedonia
as well as Numidia called both consuls away.

4 P. Scipio Nasica, 1.. Bestia] The gentile name of each, Cornelius
and Calpurnius, is omitted, awkwardly enough in the latter's case, as he
is immediately afterwards referred to by it. [There is however some
doubt as to the correctness of the text: see Mommsen R. F. i. 41⁰⁸] “

Bestia] distinguished himself after the death of C. Gracchus by
effecting the recall of Popilius (see on 31. 7) whose banishment Gracchus
had secured.
