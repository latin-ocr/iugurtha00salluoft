112 SALLUST, JUGURTHA

2 a principio] ‘at the outset.'
p1er1sque...eom·uptis] concessive, ‘although . ’
factione] 8. 1 n.
3 postea...quam] of course go together.
4 fidei causa] ‘to inspire confidence‘: so 85. τι).
quaestor] The quaestorship was the lowest of the important
magistr-acies. For the military quaestor see Intr. p. xxi, for another

6 pro] as in 8. 2.

7 rogandos] the electioris for 110 (held some time in 1 1 1).

CHAPTER XXX.
