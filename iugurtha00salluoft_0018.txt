xii THE IUGURTHA OF SALLUST

from the intention which he originally set himself—of writing
separate essays on epochs of Roman historyl.

The Romans had not a very clear idea of the functions of
the historiari. Quintilian2 says ‘history is very near to poetry:
it is a kind of poem free from the trammels of metre, written
with a view to description rather than proof of any particular
point,’ and Cicero3‚ whilst maintaining that different laws are to
be observed in writing history and in writing poetry, implies
that he thought the former a task peculiarly suitable for an
orator. The earliest Roman historians actually wrote in Greek z
the elder Cato was the first to use Latin sor this purpose4. The
rhetorical tendency is generally assumed to have been very
clear in Caelius (Gracchan period), whilst the first trace of
critical power is claimed for Claudius Quadrigarius⁶ (Sullan
period). Cicero implies⁶ that Claudius' contemporary, Sisenna,
beat all his predecessors, and yet the result was puerile quiddam.
This author is cited by Sallust⁷ in terms of appreciation, and his
love os areliaism, attested by Cicero, may have helped to form
Sallust's style. But the fragments of the early historians are
very scanty, and the criticisms of the ancients upon these
authors are not always very satisfactoryssz for us, Roman history
begins with Sallust and Caesar. The form of Caesar's writings
is unpretentious enough, though skill is displayed in bringing
out the merits of the general: their aim is practical. But in
Sallust we recognise the predecessor of Livy and Tacitus.

The rhetorical side of Sallust‘s writings is visible at a glance.

1 Cat. 4. 2. 2 10.1. 31.

3 Leg. 1. 4 and 5. The second statement is put in the mouth
of Atticus, as a view held by Cicero himself.

4 for Sallust's debt to Cato see below, p. xvi.

⁵ Mainly because, as his first book treated of the Gallie conquest
of Rome, it is assumed that he threw overboard all the fabulous period.

⁶ l. c. 7. ⁷ Iug. 95. 2.

²³ For instance, in Brut. 66, Cicero says Cato's origines contained
every florem aut lumen eloquentiae, and yet in De Or. 2. 53 classes
him with historia'ns who do not understand quibus rebus ornetur oratio.
