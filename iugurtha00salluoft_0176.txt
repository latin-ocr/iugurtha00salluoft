136 SALLUST, JUGURTHA

Cnsprmz LVII.

1 Zamam] where of course he found Metellus by this tinie arrived.
2 pro] 9. 2 n.
curaret] dependent jussive or deliberative: cp. 109. 1, R. 1612. For
the word, see on 46. 7.
4 pro ingenio] ‘ according to his temperament ἐ cp. 58. 2.
glande] the collective out of sheer desire sor variety. These leaden
sling-bullets have been found in Greece and Italy: sometimes they bear
inscriptions such as ‘ Take this' or ‘ Hit Pompey' (the enerny’s general:
pete Pompeium).
in manibus] like comminus: cp. 89. 2 in manns uenturum.

5 ardentia] goes with sudes, pila, picem. But many os the pila at all
events would not carry fire. [Herzog's conjecture ardenti gets over
this difficulty: we have to imagine then vessels filled with burning pine
wood (? taeda: ‘resin')‚ pitch and sulphur: cp. Caes. B.C. 2. 11 cupas
taeda ar pice refertas. But the position of ardenti is very objectionable.
Comparing 60. 6 I would read picem sulphure mixtam et tela ardentia]

6 tormentis] the artillery of the ancients, divided, strictly, into cala-
pultae (which are referred to here) and ballistae (which threw stanes). It
is rather curious that we find no mention here of arieles as in 76. 6.

parique periculo...erant] The ablatives are those of quality—the
use with fericulo is a little bold. S. means that brave man and coward
were equally in danger, but when the brave man fell, in the thick of the
fight‚ he won glory, which those qui procul manserant could not hope
for. It is a bit of cynicism that quite reminds one of S.'s admirer
Tacitus.

CHAPTER LVIII.

1 remissis] the other abl. is involved in the qui clause: cp. on 56. 2.
2 pro] 57· 4·
3 amplius] is not followed by quam, nor yet does it take the abl.:
cp. 68. 3, 105. 3, R. 1273. But contrast 76. 1.
nomims] ‘honour.'
quam atii] supply cepere, alii being=ceteri (Romani) as often.

pauci...frustrari: their enemies were so numerous they could hardly ¹

miss. The passive implies the archaic active form frustrare: 17. 711.
adcessissent} The subj. appears to be that of repeated action—the
only ex. os it in S„ unless we explain iussissetis in ¹4· 10 thus.
