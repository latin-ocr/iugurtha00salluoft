140 SALLUST, IUGURTHA

praesidiis] ‘means of defence ’—the elephaiitS‚ horses, arms, money
and men of ἐξ 5, 6.

10 de prouinciis consultus] according to the Sempronian law (27. 3 n.).
For consultus see on 15. 2.

Metello decreuerat] This is not strictly accurate. What they were
required to do by the law was to fix what provinces should belong to
the forthcoming consuls. In this case they abstained from naming
Numidia as one of those provinces, thereby prolonging M.’s term os

office, as a general or governor kept his power until his successor was
named. Cp. 75. 711.

CHAPTER LXIII.

1 ageret] jussive suhj. :imperative of Or. Rect. The object is to be
derived from quae agilabat: see on 56. 2. Most writers would have put
agilaret, but S. affects the ind.: Intr. p. xvii.

2 abunde erant] so elsewhere in S.‚ and the younger Pliny. S. is
fond of using adverbs with csse: see on 85. ¹7 and 87. 4 and cp. the
frequent frustra esse (eg. 7. 6, 71. 5, 73. 7).

domi] in dealing with his fellow citizens.
modicus] ‘unambitious’: cp. 85. 1.

3 sed] introduces the digression as to M.’s history: cp. Cat. 18. 1,
50. 3. The idea may be, ‘but Ι forgot to tell you’: cp. however what
is said on 5. 5.

Arpini] is curiously placed: of course it goes with both participles.

stipendiis faciundis] He began at the siege of Numantia (7. 2 n.).

Graeca facundia] Cp. 85. 32 where he says himself neque litteras
Graecas didici and Mommsen, R. H. 3 p. 444: ‘declamatory exercises
(in Latin) on the current themes of the Greek schools became a per-
manent iugi-edient in the education of Roman youth, and contributed
their part to educate the very boys as sorensic and political players and
stifle in the bud all earnest and true eloquence.’

munditiis] ‘elegance.' He was no ‘gilded popinjay,’ to use the
diction of a later century.

4 tribunatum militarem a populo] Intr. p. xxii.

facile] ie. when his exploits were mentioned. [But this is not very .
clear writing, and factis or fama, the conjectures of Palfuerius and
Scheindler respectively, would greatly improve matters]

per omnis tribus] all the electoral divisions voted sor him. There
were 35 of these lrilms, into which the whole area os Italy was divided.
