NOTES Ῑ47

un alteri] ¹3. 1 n.

moderata] ‘were the guiding influences.' Note sua referring to
Metellus and Marius, who are certainly not the grammatical subj. to
the sentence: see on 9. 2.

capitis] 3²- 1 n.

in maius] lit. ‘with a tendency to exaggeration.'

res fidesque] ‘property (means) and credit-⁵ For in manibus cp.
Cat. 37. 7 in agris manuum mercede inopiam tolerauerat.

post multas tempestates] for the first time since 130 B.C.

popmus...rogatus etc.] except in the declining period of the Republic
the popular assemblies avoided thus interfering in a personal question of
this kind. Cp. however Liu. 30. 27, where in 202 B.C. the tribunes
put this very question to the people (quem uellent z'n Africa bellum gerere)
—at the suggestion, it is true, os the senate.

sed paulo amic etc.] S. means that the senate had not named
Numidia as one of the provinces for the forthcoming consuls: see on
62. 10. It appears then that the people could actually cancel the
arrangements which the senate made under the lex Sempronia. But oi
course the Roman constitution was crumbling to pieces, and by 88 B.C.
it was possible sor them to shift the command from the magistrate named
by the senate to a private individual (see on 63. 6). [The good MSS.
omit the words in italics—except that a few read senatus. The text is
given only by interpolated MSS„ which probably got it from ch. 62.
However something of the kind must have stood here]

CHAPTER LXXIV.

eodem tempore] Yet the events just mentioned took place at the
end of 108, and those he is about to describe belong to the beginning
of the campaign of that year. Cp. Intr. p. xiv.

a good ex. of S.'s love for variety. Cp. Cat. 3 3. 1 plerique patriae sed
